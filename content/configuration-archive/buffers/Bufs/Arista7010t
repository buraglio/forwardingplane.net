<h2>Arista 7010T</h2>
<p>
It appears that Arista introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010740/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7010T-48_Datasheet.pdf">this switch</a> in August or Sept of 2014. 
There has been no splash in the trade press. 
Perhaps Arista is merely filling a hole in their high performance product line with a modest product that carries the Arista feature set and has good power consumption.
I placed this switch in the table next to an IBM offering with somewhat similar specifications, but proximity should not be considered to mean anything.

Thanks to ruairi carroll for bringing this to my attention.
