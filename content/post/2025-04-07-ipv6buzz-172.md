Listener comments and questions are always interesting. In this episode we talk through some listeners questions that have come in via the [Follow Up on packetpushers.net](https://packetpushers.net/fu).  

We cover questions regarding IPv6 for small businesses, then go even smaller and answer a question about IPv6 for home networks.  Lastly, we have a quick discussion about Path MTU discovery with IPv6 (spoiler:  weâ€™re planning a whole episode on this topic in the future).
