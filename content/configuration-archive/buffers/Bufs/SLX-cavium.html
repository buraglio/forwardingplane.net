Announcement date of this Cavium Xpliant based switch: December 6, 2016.
<p>
The release is <b>one day</b> after Arista announced their 7160 products. Brocade
also released the SLX-9540 at the same time. If <i>Networking</i> had an annual 
award for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010752/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/bbb.html"> cliche ridden product information</a> 
that at the same time manages to
keep actual content to a bare minimum, the contest would already be over
for this year.
<p>
