This is the first Tofino2 switch I can find. It is possible (likely?)
that some hyperscalers may have incorporated the Tofino2 into switches
customized for their applications. There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010609/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Edgecore_AS9516-32D_datasheet.pdf">
datasheet.</a> The interface diagram in the datasheet identifies the ports as 100G QSFP-DD.
This is almost certainly an error. It should say <i>QSFP56-DD 400G</i>.
<p>
<b>Update August 2021</b>
<p>
The port speed mistake noted above has been fixed and the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010609/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/edge-core_as9516-32d_datasheet-2.pdf"> new datasheet</a> 
is no longer marked as <i>preliminary</i>. The switch is orderable
from Stordis. A 3 minute video with zippy music has announced the
invention of <i>sliced bread</i>, perhaps indicating that the
switch is now actually available. It appears that Edgecore is
using two different model numbers for this switch. The
other one is <b>DCS810</b>. 
<p>
The data sheet says <b>Compatible with ONL and SONiC software</b>
