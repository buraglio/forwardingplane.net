        I&#8217;ve been looking at iMessage from time to time as my schedule permits, for some reason that I can&#8217;t really explain I&#8217;m fixated on it. So, just like I did with FaceTime, I started doing network sniffing to see just what it&#8217;s doing. The results were not terribly unexpected.   iPhone.buraglio.com.53140  st11p01st-courier143-bz.push.apple.com.5223: Flags [R], cksum 0x5ec8 (correct), seq 4109691913, win 0, length 0 14:07:51.665485 IP (tos 0x20, ttl 49, id 11699, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 64, bad cksum 0 (-8fc7)!

        Lets just say, for instance, that you have an MX series router at somewhere on your network. Lets also say that said router is carved into more than just the main logical system. For the sake of this writing, lets say that your eBGP sessions are in the default logical system and your IGP is in the logical system, lets call it &#8220;internal&#8221;.
JunOS has some wonderful mechanisms for keeping things running, one is called NSR (Non Stop Routing), the other is called ISSU (In Service Software Upgrade).

        Data centers are one of the hot things in networking tech right now. Combine SDN, cloud, buzzword of the day, mix with data center and serve over ice.
I end up doing a lot with data centers for whatever reason. This, however, is something I found interesting.
&#8220;DCTCP is an enhancement to the TCP congestion control algorithm for data center networks. It leverages Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), a feature which is increasingly becoming available in modern data center switches.

        I&#8217;ve been doing research, carrier and service provider networking for a long time. I my first real service provider experience was beta testing DSL for GTE back in the 1990s, I prototyped and proposed a CLEC for an employer in 1998 and went to work for the only ISP in the area rolling it&#8217;s own DSL over ATM in early 2000.
Everything seems to come full circle, though, given enough time.

        Let me save you some time&#8230;.Microflow Policing on the Catalyst 6500 / Sup2TXL doesn&#8217;t yet work. Inbound it &#8220;kinda works&#8221;. You can configure it and it applies as a service policy, but even though outbound is &#8220;supported in hardware on the Supervisor2TXL&#8221;, there is no software support for it in either the 15.0SY or 12.2(50)SY. It took me a month to suss this out&#8230;..
Yes, I should have suspected. I dont work on Cisco every day, I have Juniper MX, Brocade MLX and a multitude of other platforms to work on daily, so it took a bit.

        I&#8217;m an awful sysadmin. Running services permanently isn&#8217;t really my forte, I tend to lean more on the &#8220;I&#8217;ll get this proof of concept all working, prove that it works or doesn&#8217;t, then roll it on for polishing by someone else&#8221; kinda guy. That final 15% is something I&#8217;m constantly working to refine and better myself at accomplishing. I&#8217;m decent at debugging network services, and can be handy in a &#8220;oh crap, it&#8217;s down!

        Moving to JunOS from IOS can be a daunting task. It&#8217;s a completely different command structure and the config, by default, looks like a programming language. I was fortunate enough to have gotten in on using JunOS very early in my career, 1&frasl;3 in to be exact (as of this writing). Not to mention that wen I got started, IOS wasn&#8217;t the only game in town. Remember Xylan? Gandalf? OpenRoute?

        As I sit here thinking if this site is worth my time, some words that someone said to me recently ring true. &#8220;Take from things you&#8217;re doing every day&#8221; is what Brent Salisbury of networkstatic.net said to me. He was right.
&#8230;And it was why I originally started this site, in a way. The original goal was to make a site I could take notes on and possibly help out someone trying to solve the same issues as me or look at something from the same perspective I had.

        If I had my perfect world where I lived in a gumdrop house with lollypop trees and everything smelled like butterfly kisses, here is what I would like to see in WAN networking gear. I can build a list for LAN and edge gear as well. It&#8217;s not a golden rocket ship I&#8217;m looking for. OK, maybe it is.  Full MPLS support   Full IPv6 support, all the features, not just pieces.

        Recently we&#8217;ve run into an odd issue while routing on an EX4200 series. These little JunOS boxes are a nice alternative for an entry level building router, they support L2/L3 functionality, a PVST+-ish protocol and, with advanced licensing, IPv6, ISIS and BGP. They have multi 10G interface options and come in a pluggable fiber option. We use them all over for light layer 3. They can also be stacked via stacking cables and fiber, which is very handy and makes them extremely versatile but not really applicable for the purpose of this entry.
