<h2>Alpha Networks SNX-61A0-486T</h2>
<p>
First appearance of this switch was on a conference call in February 2017.
<p>
<b>This switch may not exist. While it was submitted to OCP, there is no data sheet.</b>

Alpha Networks has a 2-year old switch based on the Trident2+ which, along
with a <i>gearbox</i> ASIC, provided four 100 Gb/s uplink ports. This
is the follow-on to that switch, based on the <b>Maverick ASIC</b>. It has at least some SERDES capable of
running at 25 Gb/s -- and hence the built-in 100 Gb/s ports. What we
don't know is the number of switch cores and buffer memory per core.
Details are in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010724/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/maverick-oc.pdf">OpenCompute Project submission</a>.
<p>
That submission says that the switch bandwidth is 880 Gb/s. That is less than
the sum of the port speeds. Some of the details about this part may not be 
entirely correct.
<p>
It is also listed as Maverick in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010724/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Alpha-OCP&#32;Networking&#32;Preso-2017-02-13-Four&#32;Contributed&#32;Switches.pdf">
slide show presentation</a> to OCP when four switches were submitted for standardization.
