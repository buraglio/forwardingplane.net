After creating an [alternative to smokeping](https://www.forwardingplane.net/post/2025-05-09-tokeping/) in GoLang, I spoke with Ethan over at the [packet pushers](https://www.packetpushers.net) and we thought "why not do a podcast about latency?" 
Latency is an important, often overlooked, and less understood aspect of networking. This rings true regardless of the network type - HPC, wide area, carrier, data center, and campus all need to have reasonable latency in order to perform their intended functions.

So, circling back to what I *thought* was my [very first Packet Pushers guest spot](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/heavy-networking/hn131-golf-cart-in-my-fibre-tunnel/), but was actually [https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/heavy-networking/hn163-open-source-perfsonar-finds-the-flaws-impacting-the-flows/](my second), we talk about my favorite toolkit, [PerfSonar](https://github.com/perfsonar/), and many more.
