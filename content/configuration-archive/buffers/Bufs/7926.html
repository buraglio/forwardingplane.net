<p>
Introduced as an OCP submission in July 2019, all we have
seen so far is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010728/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/EdgecoreAS7926-80X.pdf">this design
package</a>. While this is better than a data sheet, we really
want both to be assured that there is a product.
<p>
This is an 80 port 100 Gb/s switch. The serdes on the Jericho2
are 50 Gb/s PAM, so the switch is loaded with gearbox ICs to
maximize the port count.
<p>
<b>Update August 2021</b>
<p>
Two switches: AS7926-40XK and AS7926-80XK. The first
40-port switch has a single Jericho2 ASIC. The 80-port switch
has two Jericho2 ASICs linked together without a cross-bar
element -- that isn't needed when there are only two switch
ASICs. So far, still no data sheets. I believe that the <b>K</b>
in the part number indicates that the switch has external TCAM.
<b>Still no data sheets.</b> None of the regular suspects (<i>e.g.</i>
ASA-computers) are offering to sell these switches. I suspect
that these switches have died a silent death -- replaced by
the 7926-40XKFB announced in July 2021.
