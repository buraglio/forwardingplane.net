bviously useful skill set: Understanding code and automation. It’s powerful and <strong>will</strong> make your professional life easier. Do you need to obsess over it? Probably not (do you need to obsess over any of it?!?). Remember that internet thing that I mentioned before? Yeah, there are a lot of resources there. Search engines are your friend.</p>

<p>Will you need to know the concepts? For sure. Guess what, though? There are a <strong>ton</strong> of resources for that too.</p>

<p>As I was brainstorming this, I mind-mapped some of the things that jumped into my brain [<a href="https://mindnode.com/">mindnode pro</a> is a fantastic app for this, I highly recommend it]. Things that get a lot of attention and maybe deserve a cursory glance. Lets break them down in a simple-ish and concise-ish manner and understand that by the time of this writing I’m positive it will be outdated and there will be some new whiz-bang thing that the marketing machine will be saying is the “something-killer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here are the high level things I see thrown around a lot. For what it’s worth, OpenDayLight has <a href="http://www.opendaylight.org/project/technical-overview">a page</a> with some definitions that is pretty good, too.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Tech-Relationships.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Tech-Relationships.png" alt="Networking Tech Relationships" /></a></p>

<p>This is absolutely <strong>not</strong> all-encompassing and is likely missing major things, however, the point is really not to be accurate as much as it is to demonstrate that there is a <strong>monumental</strong> amount of scope that is in some ways interconnected and in other ways completely autonomous. It is also pretty clear that due to the nature of what “DevOps” is, it has ties into many other things.</p>

<p>The biggest take-away is that the communication paths need to be there - Better communication between these specializations makes for better, more secure, more usable tools.</p>

<p>It is how the DevOps is done, <strong>not</strong> what it is doing.</p>

<p>What I am really getting at here is that there is no need to get overwhelmed. You don’t need to know all of this stuff. If you know a little about most of it and a lot about one or two topics, then in my opinion you are doing really, really well.</p>

<p>My best advice to any new IT person is not to know everything but to know where to find it - and then share what you learned.</p>
