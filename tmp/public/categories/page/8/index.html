        Lately I&#8217;ve been lamenting the fact that there seems to be a lack of options in a very specific product level. Lets say you have a network that looks like this:
&nbsp;
Right Away you&#8217;re limited since you need MPLS and more than 2 10G interfaces. Even more so if you require full support for IPv6 and ISIS.
If budget is of any concern, you&#8217;re in real trouble.
For many, Cisco pricing and smartnet is potentially going to exclude anything reasonable from them.

        The SDN world is abuzz with the announcement that the OpenDaylight controller came from stealth mode today. Why is this important? Well, SDN and OpenFlow are fractured. It is Mac vs. PC, Beta vs VHS, Coke vs. Pepsi all over again&#8230;&#8230;multiplied by 100x and with a handful of players.

Vendor zealots and brand loyalists will nearly always side with their camp. Heck, even I have some biases of personal preference.

        OpenFlow is, of course, a hot buzzword. It&#8217;s the newest, and in my opinion, the most innovative thing to hit data networking since dynamic routing. The ability to programmatically, systematically and potentially dynamically control traffic at the flow level through a network is innovative, exciting and terrifying [to many network engineers and architects] at the same time. Allowing applications to touch the network change behavior is something that many engineers are not terribly comfortable with.

        I had been working, off and on, on a how-to for building the daylight openflow controller under CentOS. Most openflow docs and dev are done under ubuntu or debian, and while those are both fantastic alternatives, there are a huge number of folks that will want or need to use RHEL or CentOS. So, seeing as that is the case, having someone be mindful of that is important. When I saw the write up by Jon Langemak, I scrapped my attempt at a how-to since his was so much better.

        Let me preface this post by saying that I am absolutely not an enterprise IT or systems guy, take everything that I write here on out with that as a side dish. I&#8217;m also very, very cheap.
That said, one of the things I really like about KVM is the ability to easily view the console of a guest system using free, non-windows software like VNC. However, much like everything in life, there are reasons to do one thing or another.

        Jon Langemak has a great write up on building the OpenDaylight controller under CentOS. Since I&#8217;ll have to do this a bunch of times, I though tI&#8217;d take what he so generously put online and build a very rudimentary script for deploying ODC under CentOS. The prerequisites are that you already have an account and ssh key at the OpenDaylight GIT repo and that you disable SELinux. Here is the script: #!

        There has been some recent chatter on the IPv6 Ops mailing list about the feature matrix. Sadly, I&#8217;ve let this sort of wither on the vine for a while in favor of OpenFlow and SDN. At the end of the day, though, as a whole we actually need IPv6 more than SDN and OpenFlow at this moment in time, so I&#8217;m resurrecting it. It is available here.
A few additions have been made and there is now a &#8220;last edited&#8221; cell so folks can tell if the data is stale or not.

        I love to be the &#8220;uncola&#8221; of networking sites. I like interop and I don&#8217;t do a lot with Cisco because I don&#8217;t have access to much of their gear anymore. So, that being the case, I had a need to bring up a l2circuit (in JunOS speak), or VLL (in Brocade speak) between an MX480 and an MLX. Since they are very different platforms, I had to do some digging and playing around to get it to work.

        I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of MPLS in the last 45 or so days (which is one of the reasons I have been absentee in the OpenFlow world lately). Having had almost no real world MPLS experience aside from a handful of pseudo-wires and a very small LDP signaled network, I had to spend some time reading, hacking at routers and essentially learning. In doing so, I found a few things.

        I recently had the need to debug a run away ip_rx process on an older Brocade MLX. For anyone that has had to do any type of low level debugging on the Brocade (Foundry) platform, you know that there many somewhat deep level diagnostics that are possible. The debug (like cisco debug) is a bit lacking, but the dm, LP and MP commands are very useful (and a tad scary).
