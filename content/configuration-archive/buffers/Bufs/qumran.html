<b>Introduced Nov 16, 2016</b>
<p>
Qumran backfills behind Jericho that was introduced in 2015.
<p>
Qumran is a single chip version of Jericho. It has not intended to
connect to a backplane crossbar switch -- and hence <i>single chip.</i>
Its place in the hierarchy is to fill the deep buffer top-of-rack 
requirement. It's big brother <b>Jericho</b> is intended for a
chassis environment where each line card gets a Jericho and there is
a crossbar switch in the backplane. Some fixed form factor switches
contain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010700/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AGC5648.html">two Jericho ASICs directly connected</a> 
through their crossbar interfaces in a 1 RU package so you can't tell the
internals from looking at the package alone.
<p>
Three sizes of Qumram have been announced by Broadcom -- variously
refered to as Papa Bear <b>MX</b>, Mama Bear <b>AX</b>, Baby Bear <b>UX</b>.

At the September 2019 regional OCP conference Carsten Michel (Deutsche Telekom)
presented on new switches designed to fill the BNG (border Network Gateway)
slot. These switches -- one leaf, one spine -- will use the Qumran 2C when
it becomes available. Meanwhile, Delta is building prototypes with the
Jericho 2C which is a pin-for-pin equivalent except that the latter has
a fabric interface that is not needed here.
