      <description>Brent Salisbury - Nov 3, 2012
Nice thoughts Nick. The SP is moving quickly on this. You keyed in on the part that is such a question mark. How do inter-domain exchange information safely and usefully. Good thing is the content providers have been doing similar things for a long time. When I click post your site will do an OAUTH to Google. APIs and open source might be the ticket.</description>

      <description>There has been a flurry of discussion on SDN in the WAN lately, specifically, why and how. Brent Salsbury laid out a few use cases here. The why seems pretty straightforward. I do believe it will happen, however, the how is the interesting part. Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m a tad of a greenhorn in the SDN space, I&amp;rsquo;ve made it work in a lab, I participate as much as I can in the working groups and I attempt (poorly) to keep up.</description>
