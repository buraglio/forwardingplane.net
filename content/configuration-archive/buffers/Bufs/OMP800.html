Big switch with 256 ports. Perhaps useful in the data center. But probably
now obsolete and replaced by sommething with a heart of Tomahawk-2. While
Cumulus Networks thinks this is a Tomahawk, that the QSFP28 ports can be
broken out would make it a Tomahawk+. Probably a distinction without a 
difference.
