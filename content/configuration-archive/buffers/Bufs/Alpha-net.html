<h2>Alpha Networks SNX-60x0-486x</h3>

<i>from Open Compute Project Alpha Networks SNX-60x0-486T Specification v0.6</i>
<p>
<pre>
SNX-6070-486F   Freescale CPU
SNX-60A0-486F   Intel CPU
</pre>
There is some confusion between the SNX-60x0-486T submitted to the Open Compute Project and the data sheet for the Alpha Networks part.
It seems like Alpha Networks is describing a Trident2+ for OCP and the older Trident2 for their data sheet. 
<p>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010747/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Alpha-Trident2+.pdf">OCP submission</a> says <i>Trident2+</i> in Figure 7 and shows the gearbox to generate 100 Gb/s ports.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010747/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Alpha-datasheet.pdf">data sheet for the same p/n</a> does not say anything about 100 Gb/s ports or RIOT.
<p>
In a presentation to an OpenCompute working group on February 13, 2017 Alpha said that this switch is based on a Broadcom part
code named <b>Maverick</b> The part number is <b>BCM56768</b>. <i>Maverick</i> is the name of a company acquired by Broadcom
in 1999. There appears to be no relation between the the chip and the acquired company.
