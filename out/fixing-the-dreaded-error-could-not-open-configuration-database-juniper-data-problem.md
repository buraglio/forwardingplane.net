Working on some MX series routers recently I encountered a problem I'd never seen before, essentially preventing the configuration from being committed:```
buraglio@rtr# commit check
re0:
error: could not open configuration database (juniper.data+)
```This is a very annoying problem and is terribly inconvenient as you can probably imagine. So, my first instinct is to drop down to the shell and starting hacking at it UNIX style.```
buraglio@rtr>start shell
```From there I wanted to see the file system and check out the stats of what it thinks we have.```
buraglio@rtr% df -h

```Playing around in the shell presented this error as well```
/var: create/symlink failed, no inodes free
```So, it appears as if the /var partition is the issue. On my router /var is mounted as /dev/ad1s1f, so lets unmount this partition and try to fix it. In my experience Juniper will shy away from telling you to do anything in the shell, so do this at your own risk. Rebooting the router would also fix this issue, but I'm a form believer that rebooting networking equipment to fix issues is a lazy way to fix problems and will only serve to atrophy any troubleshooting skills you may have.```

```And....you're done. Hopefully this will help someone fight this problem, I only found a [handful](http://www.gns3.net/labs/juniper/jncia-junos/operational-monitoring-and-maintenance/) of [other references](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Junos-and-Junosphere/Commit-Errors/td-p/17615) to it that was useful but it didn't address my exact scenario.
