Introduced June 2015 -- according to Network World
<p>
The X460-G2 switch, announced October 2014, is very similar to the X450-G2. They differ
in stacking options.
<p>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010757/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Summit-X450-G2.pdf"> data sheet</a> dated 1 year after introduction says
that the whole family of Summit switches can be stacked.  SummitStack-V is compatible with Summit X440,
X450-G2 switches with 10Gb uplinks, X460, X460-G2 with 10Gb uplinks, X480,
X670, X670V, X670-G2 and X770. There is no industry standard for stacking. A proprietary tag carrying
packet metadata like port of arrival and output destination port is attached to every packet placed
on the stacking bus. Any switches that are stack-compatible are drawn from related silicon.

Noting that the X770 has been ID'd as a Trident II, Extreme appears to be a Broadcom shop.
