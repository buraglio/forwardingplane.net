I started working on Juniper equipment around 2002. At my employer, we had an M40 with the serial number 256.  We did Layer3 only.  I had no idea if the Juniper even did layer2.  It certainly wasn't a layer3 switch like a 6500 like I was used to.  It was like a deliciously robust version of any Layer 3 router I'd worked on previously.  Over the years <a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juniper</a> has added a <a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/ex-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">switching line</a> utilizing their FreeBSD based OS, <a href="http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/nos/junos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JunOS</a>.
All that being said, I'd never really messed with doing a layer2 transit VLAN on a JunOS routing platform.  Lets say we want to make 2 VLANs and transit them up through the WAN.  Here is how to make it work on an MX:
Create the bridge domains:
<pre>set bridge-domains vlan-123 domain-type bridge
set bridge-domains vlan-123 vlan-id 123
set bridge-domains vlan-124 domain-type bridge
set bridge-domains vlan-123 vlan-id 124
</pre>
Configure the interfaces facing south (LAN) to nbe members of the VLAN:
<pre>
set interfaces xe-1/0/0 description "SW1 xe-1/1/0"
set interfaces xe-1/0/0 mtu 9192
set interfaces xe-1/0/0 unit 0 description "Untagged VLAN 123"
set interfaces xe-1/0/0 unit 0 family bridge interface-mode access
set interfaces xe-1/0/0 unit 0 family bridge vlan-id 123
set interfaces xe-1/0/1 description "SW1 xe-1/1/1"
set interfaces xe-1/0/1 mtu 9192
set interfaces xe-1/0/1 unit 0 description "Untagged VLAN 123"
set interfaces xe-1/0/1 unit 0 family bridge interface-mode access
set interfaces xe-1/0/1 unit 0 family bridge vlan-id 123
set interfaces xe-1/0/2 description "SW2 xe-1/1/2"
set interfaces xe-1/0/2 mtu 9192
set interfaces xe-1/0/2 unit 0 description "Untagged VLAN 124"
set interfaces xe-1/0/2 unit 0 family bridge interface-mode access
set interfaces xe-1/0/2 unit 0 family bridge vlan-id 124
set interfaces xe-1/0/3 description "SW2 xe-1/1/3"
set interfaces xe-1/0/3 mtu 9192
set interfaces xe-1/0/3 unit 0 description "Untagged VLAN 124"
set interfaces xe-1/0/3 unit 0 family bridge interface-mode access
set interfaces xe-1/0/3 unit 0 family bridge vlan-id 124
</pre>
Now add it to the uplink (that in this case has a layer3 instance on it as well):
<pre>
set interfaces et-5/0/0 description "100G North"
set interfaces et-5/0/0 vlan-tagging
set interfaces et-5/0/0 mtu 9192
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 123 description "L3 testing vlan 123"
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 123 family bridge interface-mode trunk
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 123 family bridge vlan-id-list 123
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 124 description "L3 testing vlan 124"
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 124 family bridge interface-mode trunk
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 124 family bridge vlan-id-list 124
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 100 description "VLAN100 Layer3 Peering"
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 100 vlan-id 100
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 100 family inet mtu 9000
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 100 family inet address 10.100.100.1/30
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 100 family inet6 mtu 9000
set interfaces et-5/0/0 unit 10 family inet6 address 2001:fd8:a100:100::1/64
</pre>
Now check your bridge table:
<pre>
buraglio@mx480> show bridge domain
Routing instance        Bridge domain            VLAN ID     Interfaces
default-switch          vlan-123                 123
                                                             et-5/0/0.123
                                                             xe-1/0/0.0
                                                             xe-1/0/1.0
default-switch          vlan-124                 124
                                                             et-5/0/0.124
                                                             xe-1/0/2.0
                                                             xe-1/0/3.0
</pre>
That's it.  Pretty straightforward.
