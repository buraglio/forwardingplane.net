NFD Disclaimer: Tech Field Day is covering my travel and miscellaneous costs for this event. They in turn are paid by their sponsors. I am under no obligation to write anything about any of the presentations, favorable or otherwise. Â  All opinions expressed are my own and in no way reflect any other entities other than myself. In addition, they are simply opinions based on my experiences and the facts known at the time of posting and should be thought of as such. I try to present my findings as factually and impartially as possible and receive no payment for my participation or writings. Actually, I will actively refuse it as I like to try to remain impartial.
