        Every year there is an international conference for High Performance Computing, or HPC as it is often called. This is a bit of a niche in that it&#8217;s something that many enterprises and researchers need but don&#8217;t do themselves and so many don&#8217;t have a grasp as to what all is invoved. It&#8217;s a specialized, potentially expensive and very different environment as well as mindset than the general sysadmin or network engineer will ever see.

        For the Supercomputing 2012 show, as in years past, I was &#8220;the guy who installed and maintained RANCID&#8221; as part of my duties for the SCinet routing team. If you don&#8217;t know about RANCID for change management and config back up, check the link. It&#8217;s ree and works on a huge amount of gear. Every year there is a new and interesting platform, this year is was Juniper qfabric and Brocade VDX.

        Recently, there was a thread over at Packet Pushers about what folks use for their daily workflow. I quickly realized that my setup is pretty simple (as I like it) and relied on a large amount of terminal based tools, which makes sense since I have been a UNIX (or UNIX based) OS user since my migration from the original MacOS back in the 1990s. Anyway, Since I wrote most of this up already, I thought I&#8217;d post it here: Envoronment and Editing Editor: VIM via Terminal.

        Have you ever needed to replicate a lot of data transparently to an IDS without the use of a rack of optical taps? Not enough budget for a Gigamon or cPacket? Have a spare MLXe laying around? you&#8217;re in luck, we were in that boat too.
Let me first preface this by saying that this would be fairly trivial using OpenFlow / SDN. That being said, we didn&#8217;t have the time to set that up, so this is what we came with.

        There has been a flurry of discussion on SDN in the WAN lately, specifically, why and how. Brent Salsbury laid out a few use cases here. The why seems pretty straightforward. I do believe it will happen, however, the how is the interesting part. Admittedly, I&#8217;m a tad of a greenhorn in the SDN space, I&#8217;ve made it work in a lab, I participate as much as I can in the working groups and I attempt (poorly) to keep up.

        For a long time I ran a blog called tech.buraglio.com that was a self hosted wordpress site. After having kids and getting a bit busier at work, I decided to move everything that I had been hosting (images, scripts, hacks, blogs and DNS) to &#8220;the cloud&#8221;. I managed to do this for everything but my primary DNS resolver, which I had always intended to keep, and one wordpress blog that I hosted for someone else.

        ~12 years ago I had a drinking buddy that worked with me at the regional ISP. We had a lot in common, he had been an icon back in the didjits era of punk rock in Champaign Urbana and we had briefly been in a terrible band together. He introduced me to a dude that to this day I just knew as &#8220;Ravi Sonicwall&#8221;. He had apparently been recruited from the U of I, written a lot of the low level pieces of the original sonicwall and retired to enjoy life and buy beers (he actually scolded me at a bar for buying him a beer saying &#8220;when I&#8217;m in town, I buy the beers&#8221;).

        I recently had the opportinity to work with the much-anticipated Brocade VDX &#8220;Ethernet Fabric&#8221; platform. I do admit tha tI&#8217;m intrigued by this product. I&#8217;d seen it work multiple times in demos and it worked so well and looked to easy that we actively tried to throw curve balls at the demo organizer to prove it wasn&#8217;t canned.
It succeeded.
The hardware hashing across the VLAGs is very slick. The VMware VSwitch integration worked well and was handy.

        Plexxi is an interesting product that has recently emerged in the data center space. While data center, fabric and cloud are all the rage in the buzzword world of data networking, this one caught my attention because it was something unique that I&#8217;d not seen before. Their TOR boxes have a few interesting additions to them, the first of which is a WDM port on the back. Now, I&#8217;m not really a stranger to the WDM world.

        IPv6 is coming. Like SDN, we can&#8217;t ignore it. Are you ready? Are you apps ready? I&#8217;ll wager the answer is no. Mine aren&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been working on IPv6 for about 11 years, from early days of tunnels to full native IPv6 at home and at work. In teaching the IPv6 workshop for internet2, one of the things that I always suggest is to have a dual stacked host and an IPv6 only host available for testing.
