The Hexabuild team is providing a new community resource, an [IPv6 compatibility](https://ipv6compatibility.com/) checker, for those trying to figure out IPv6 network hardware and software compatibility. It’s currently in an alpha version. We talk about what inspired it, what it does, and possible future updates. We also want to get your feedback on whether this is useful and something we should continue to expand. It’s far from perfect, but it is a start.


Take a listen to the podcast here:
