Recently, there was a [thread over at Packet Pushers](http://forum.packetpushers.net/showthread.php/309-Productivity-or-Social-Apps?p=1276) about what folks use for their daily workflow.  I quickly realized that my setup is pretty simple (as I like it) and relied on a large amount of terminal based tools, which makes sense since I have been a UNIX (or UNIX based) OS user since my migration from the original MacOS back in the 1990s.  Anyway, Since I wrote most of this up already, I thought I'd post it here:

Editor: VIM via Terminal.app or BBEdit. Occasionally Textedit, but primarily I use VIM  
Calendar: iCalMail: [Mailplane](http://mailplaneapp.com/) ($24.95) and Mail.app (Free) (different accounts).Blogging software: Blogger interface or Wordpress editor depending on site.  Both Free.Screen capture: built in Mac hotkey (Apple+4), Free.Screen video capture: [Evocam](http://www.evological.com/evocam.html) or a clunky script I wrote that records to flv ($30)Reminder/ToDo: Apple reminders app (Free; works across all their platforms)Shell: zsh, of course (Free)
