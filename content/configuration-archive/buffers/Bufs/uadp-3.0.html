Two page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010604/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/uadp-3.0.pdf"> not-a-data-sheet.</a>
<p>
Sometime after introduction a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010604/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/catalyst-c9500.pdf">datasheet</a> appeared.
Near the end of the datasheet there is a table of revisions and their dates. It 
does not include the date of the first release.
<p>
A note in one of the CiscoLive! presentations says that UADP-3.0 is the first
ASIC in the family to have 16 nm feature size.
