<h2>Catalyst C6807-xl</h2>
<p>
<b>Introduced late 2013</b>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010617im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/6807-beautyshot.PNG" alt="7-slot chassis">
<p>
The 6807xl chassis is joined at the hip with the Supervisor 6T that was introduced at the same time.
The supervisor has its own listing in its place amoung the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010617/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/catalyst6500"> supervisor heros.</a>
The chassis also supports many line cards from the previous supervisor hit list -- as long as they are
not too old. All is listed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010617/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/6807xl-datasheet.pdf">data sheet.</a>  
<p>
The Catalyst and its family are difficult to fit into this web page's table format and Cisco
has published lots of data sheets, white papers and Ciscolive! slide decks that far exceed
the length and detail of what is presented here.
Some historical perspective can be gleaned from this marketing slide [circa 2018]:
