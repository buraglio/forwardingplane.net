Over the years one of the most common responses received when asking "does your $widget support IPv6?" is "well, no one has asked for it", or "no one actually uses IPv6". To myself and others that have been actually using IPv6 for well over 20 years, this is a tired, uninformed, and overall dull response to a legitimate feature question. 
Over the last 4 years, and likely due to the explosion of IPv6 deployments, this has become significantly less common of a reply. 
However, it does still happen. And now, because it is so very irksome, we have some compiled, cross-referenced, and easily presented evidence. We can now "bring receipts" to the assertion that IPv6 is very much alive, and in many places is not only in use, but is the majority protocol, as referenced at [stats.ipv6.army](https://stats.ipv6.army). This side, compiles data from many resources and presents them in an easily consumable - and more importantly - shareable and presentable way, citing each reference and the data sources. 
The code was developed on replit, but is now [available on github](https://github.com/buraglio/ipv6stats) and hosted independently.
