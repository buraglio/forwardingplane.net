<h2>UfiSpace S9600-32X</h2>
<table width="700">
<tr><td>
<b>Introduced Jul 27, 2021</b>
<p>
The introductory press release was followed by more substantial material like a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010648/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ufispace-S9600-32X-datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a> in December 2021.
This uses a <b>Qumran2C</b> ASIC BCM88820.
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010648/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ufispace-S9600-32X.PNG"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010648im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ufispace-S9600-32X-sm.PNG" border="4" alt="2RU switch with QSFP28 ports and timing interfaces"></a><p>
<p>
Of note, port 0 [marked in yellow] can be presented either as a single 100G QSFP28 or split into 4 x 25G SFP28. 
The switch has 2.4 Tb/s switching capacity which is somewhat less than the sum of all
the front panel ports. On the far left side are timing ports (1 pps, 10 MHz, GNSS input) used for PTP.
