<h2>7280R2 Jericho+</h2>
<b>Introduced June 2017</b>
<p>
Broadcom's Jericho+ ASIC raises the port speeds so that
what was 10 Gb/s is now 25 Gb/s. There are twenty-nine
fixed configuration varients. Broadly:

<pre>
<li> 9 models with 60 100 Gig ports 
<li>12 models with 48  25 Gig ports and  6 100 Gig ports
<li> 2 models with 30 100 Gig ports
<li> 6 models with 36  40 Gig ports and 12 100 Gig ports
</pre>

Jericho+ also has somewhat more route memory. The R2 models
also have algo-match which appears to be a feature used
to make lawyers happy.
<p>
If 29 models aren't enough, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010631/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7280R-DataSheet.pdf">
data sheet </a> covers <b>both</b> the Jericho 7280R and Jericho+
7280R2 models.
