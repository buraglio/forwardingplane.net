      <description>We all know the Packet Pushers. Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting in on the inagural &amp;ldquo;Packet Pushers Weekend Edition&amp;rdquo; - an informal, video round table where we discuss fun and relevant topics in the space of networking and other related IT topics. Much discussion was had on SR-MPLS, Service providers, SD-WAN, and Cloud. I hope to participate again, as I found the experience both entertaining and informative, I hope you will too.</description>
