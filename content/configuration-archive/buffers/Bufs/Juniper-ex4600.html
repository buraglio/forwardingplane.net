This switch was announced on August 14, 2014. The collection of ports, all on the front panel, has
diversity that challenges the ability of Juniper's 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010600/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ex4600-datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a> writers to coherently describe it. 
I believe this switch uses a Broadcom Trident 2 switch at its core.

Juniper put together an <b>excellent</b> white paper on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010600/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ex4600-buffer.pdf">
buffer management</a> that covers several switches that use Trident+ and Trident2
silicon.
