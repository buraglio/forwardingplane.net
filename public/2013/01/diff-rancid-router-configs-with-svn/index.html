<p>If you are running a network and aren&rsquo;t using <a href="http://shrubbery.net/rancid/">RANCID</a>, you should give it a serious look.  RANCID is a cross platform configuration management toolkit for backing up router configurations and certain environmental and hardware information into version control.  It&rsquo;s been around for as long as I can remember and supports nearly every platform I can think of, including a <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/vdxrancid-contrib-scripts/" title="VDXrancid contrib scripts">few</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/06/alurancid-and-pfrancid/" title="alurancid and pfrancid">modules</a> that I cobbled together myself.  There is are a few nice web based front ends for CVS and SVN, I prefer to use <a href="http://www.viewvc.org">ViewVC</a> because I have a lot of experience with it, however, there may be cases where a web server isn&rsquo;t a good option, unavailable or just too much work.  In this case, you&rsquo;ll want to know how to diff those configs from the CLI using the existing tools.  I find myself always forgetting the exact syntax of how to do this, so here it is. I prefer to use SVN, so we&rsquo;ll talk about that one here.   svn list will give a list of current devices in version control:<code>
svn list
