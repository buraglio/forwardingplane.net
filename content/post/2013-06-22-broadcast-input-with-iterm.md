As much as I like to think I automate everything, I'm pretty bad at writing code to make my life easier since it tends to take me longer to write the code and it tends to make be a bit grumpy (this is eomthing I'm fixing by learning as much code dev as I can during my limited spare time).  However, I like to think I can be fairly smart about working around my limited programming skills (think boba fett rather than jedi) by using the tools available to common folk.  Enter <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iTerm2</a>. Last I looked at this is was buggy and unstable. ....that was years and years ago.
This has changed.  <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home"><img class="alignright wp-image-681" alt="iTerm" src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/iTerm.png" width="480" height="187" /></a>
iTerm has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vastly</span> improved.   In fact, after someone suggested I look at it again, it took all of about 10 minutes for me to go all in as mt primary terminal.  The list of features is good, split pane, tabs and a wealth of customization options.  One of the big weinners for me, though, goes back to my original statement.   Being able to do broadcast input across panes, tabs or windows is fantastically useful.  If you manage systems, need to look at statistics at the same time on routers or switches or just want to do some quick and dirty "automation", this is the ticket.
I like it so much I did a quick screencast on how to do basic broadcast input.  It's really straightforward.
