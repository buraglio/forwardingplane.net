Huawei has been making trident family switches going back to Trident+ and at least as far at Trident3.
These come loaded with Huawei's switch software that looks to be pretty feature-rich. There is no
ONIE or white-box feature for switches in this family. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010727/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/huawei-6855.pdf">switch
data sheet</a> looks pretty extensive.
