        As part of a larger fun project I&#8217;m working on (OVS for the ALIX platform; more to come on that once I have it 100% working), I have been playing a lot with OVS. It&#8217;s a great platform, and as others have mentioned, it&#8217;s as close to an SDN reference data plane implementation as we have. I&#8217;d be surprised if many if not all commercial implementations of OpenFlow aren&#8217;t based on OVS.

        About a year ago I did a brief review of the &#8220;new Sonicwall&#8221;, specifically a smaller branch office device that was said should have had all of the features of the larger devices. I proposed that it had some significant limitations (much to the disagreement of a great deal of folks). However, I stand by my statements. If you ignore the fact that firewalls often cause more problems than they solve, that NAT is a nightmarish kludge (and not a security mechanism), and will likely be phased out for better options eventually, the SonicOS I tested was pretty limited as far as what I believe should be features.

        The buzz as of late around the security and networking communities has been about the NSA and their catalog or spy toolkit. I&#8217;ve spent time in my career thinking about and doing infosec and I did a brief stint working for the FBI in a project called NCDIR. I like to think that I can provide at least a peripherally competent commentary about it [take it with a grain of salt].

        I am an absolutely huge fan of statistical and instrumentation data, especially when it comes to traffic analysis, visualization and baselining. I&#8217;ve rambled on about the importance of it at every opportunity. As a result of that, I have been doing work with netflow and netflow-like data for a fairly long time. My first collector was the OSU Flow tools based stuff back around 13 years ago. From there I played with all kinds of netflow tools, both commercial and open source, finally settling most of my focus on nfdump and nfsen.

        A while ago I got an email asking me to participate in Network Field Day 7. I was very happy and humbled to get asked again since I wasn&#8217;t able to attend NFD5 or NFD6 for various reasons outside of my control (although I did try to participate with NFD5 remotely). If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the tech field day series, you should spend a little time and learn about the value it brings.

        “Hopefully there are some things here that will make you really upset in a very good way” is how Carl Moberg of Swedish based company tail-f opened up to the crowd at Networking Field Day 7 on Feb 19, 2014. Tail-f is a sleeper, I had actually never heard of them before NFD7, but they&#8217;ve got a very unique product in NCS and in my opinion it can change the way existing and future networks are managed.

        I recently had the displeasure of dealing with a series of failed disks in my newly created ZFS based NAS. I had cobbled together roughly 12TB of disk space and jammed them into an old PC, stretching the limits of the platform when I decided to go with ZFS. I broke all of the rules, underpowered, single core PC, only a handful of GIG of non-ECC RAM, etc. I&#8217;m sure storage guys are having a coronary after reading that, but it works for me and has minimal issues since I just relatively redundant need bulk storage and it doesn&#8217;t need to be fast (the ethernet connection is only 100M).

        Time to rewind from the new and shiny and get back to roots of networking. BGP is one of those odd protocols that is foundational to the functioning of the internet but yet somewhat hard to get experience with. Say what you will about this venerable protocol, it&#8217;s been here a while and it is not going anywhere any time soon. I&#8217;ve been doing BGP since around late 1999, and I completely fell into it by accident, having only the Cisco Internet Routing Architectures book (which I literally read cover to cover) and the Ulysses Black Routing Protocols Book and whatever I could find on a random search engine to guide me, and that was only after having to learn on the CLI for the first 6-7 months.

        I firmly believe that blending disciplines is the way of the future in IT. I&#8217;ve rambled about it here at other venues and I&#8217;m vocal (some would probably say brash) about it on the twitters. Be it Networking and System, Systems and Security, Programming and Networking, most of us that have been around any length of time already do it but now it&#8217;s happening out in the open and &#8220;DevOps&#8220;, a form of the hybrid IT worker, has seemingly become the BOTD (Buzzword of the day).
