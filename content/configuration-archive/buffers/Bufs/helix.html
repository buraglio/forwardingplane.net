Best guess is that <i>Helix</i> is a family of switch system on chip silicon, not
a single product. What the parts seem to have in common is 1 Gb/s access ports
and eight 10 Gb/s uplink ports. The uplink ports are commonly presented as SFP+
sockets. The silicon is capable of ganging pairs of 10 Gb/s together in a QSFP
arrangement to provide uplink ports that would be used to build switch stacks.
<p>
An example p/n is BCM56309 that has 4 Mbyte of on-chip packet buffer. This
part is called out in the Arctica 4804iq data sheet. The BCM56342 is called
out for the HPE Altoline 6900. The switch silicon is integrated with a dual
core ARM processor which is used for the switch control plane.
<p>
The release notes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010755/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/RELNOTES-SDK-5.6.6.pdf">Broadcom's SDK from 2009</a> shows lots of details of
the StraXGS family tree at its writing. It includes the product code names:
<p>
<ul>
<li> BCM56300 Helix
<li> BCM56310 Helix+
<li> BCM56320 Helix3
</ul>
So it appears that Helix4 was introduced later.  Switches described in the
release notes have 24 access ports. 48-port silicon came later.
<p>
Note added August 2019
<p>
<ul>
<li> BCM56340 Helix4 with 54 ports
<li> BCM56342 Helix4 with 30 ports
</ul>
Helix4 is used in the Edgecore AS4610-XXX switches. These switches
had their design submitted to OCP in January 2016. Note that Helix4
is more than just a switch chip. It also includes the CPU integrated
into the package.
