<h2>Cisco N3K-C3432D-S</h2>
<p>
<b>Announced October 31, 2018</b> one week after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010617/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7060-t3.html">Arista's 400G switch</a>

While Cisco has not announced this as an Innovium Teralynx merchant silicon product,

quacking noises</a> with its 70 MB packet buffer and 370 nS forwarding latency. These
parameters distinguish it from Broadcom's Tomahawk-3. Except for the two ports labeled as SFP
in the picture above, all ports are QSFP-DD.

Cisco acknowledged that this switch has a Teralynx 7 ASIC in BRKDCN-2213 (2019).
The following slide suggests that the ASIC has a unified buffer:
