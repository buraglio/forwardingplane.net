    There has been a flurry of discussion on SDN in the WAN lately, specifically, why and how. Brent Salsbury laid out a few use cases here. The why seems pretty straightforward. I do believe it will happen, however, the how is the interesting part. Admittedly, I&#8217;m a tad of a greenhorn in the SDN space, I&#8217;ve made it work in a lab, I participate as much as I can in the working groups and I attempt (poorly) to keep up.

    For a long time I ran a blog called tech.buraglio.com that was a self hosted wordpress site. After having kids and getting a bit busier at work, I decided to move everything that I had been hosting (images, scripts, hacks, blogs and DNS) to &#8220;the cloud&#8221;. I managed to do this for everything but my primary DNS resolver, which I had always intended to keep, and one wordpress blog that I hosted for someone else.

    ~12 years ago I had a drinking buddy that worked with me at the regional ISP. We had a lot in common, he had been an icon back in the didjits era of punk rock in Champaign Urbana and we had briefly been in a terrible band together. He introduced me to a dude that to this day I just knew as &#8220;Ravi Sonicwall&#8221;. He had apparently been recruited from the U of I, written a lot of the low level pieces of the original sonicwall and retired to enjoy life and buy beers (he actually scolded me at a bar for buying him a beer saying &#8220;when I&#8217;m in town, I buy the beers&#8221;).

    I recently had the opportinity to work with the much-anticipated Brocade VDX &#8220;Ethernet Fabric&#8221; platform. I do admit tha tI&#8217;m intrigued by this product. I&#8217;d seen it work multiple times in demos and it worked so well and looked to easy that we actively tried to throw curve balls at the demo organizer to prove it wasn&#8217;t canned.
It succeeded.
The hardware hashing across the VLAGs is very slick. The VMware VSwitch integration worked well and was handy.

    Plexxi is an interesting product that has recently emerged in the data center space. While data center, fabric and cloud are all the rage in the buzzword world of data networking, this one caught my attention because it was something unique that I&#8217;d not seen before. Their TOR boxes have a few interesting additions to them, the first of which is a WDM port on the back. Now, I&#8217;m not really a stranger to the WDM world.

    IPv6 is coming. Like SDN, we can&#8217;t ignore it. Are you ready? Are you apps ready? I&#8217;ll wager the answer is no. Mine aren&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been working on IPv6 for about 11 years, from early days of tunnels to full native IPv6 at home and at work. In teaching the IPv6 workshop for internet2, one of the things that I always suggest is to have a dual stacked host and an IPv6 only host available for testing.

    Securing SSH is a form or art. It&#8217;s often debated, much like blocking all ICMP packets (which I normally disagree with). If you need good proof, read these posts by Bob Plankers. There is a camp that likes to promote moving to a non-standard port. There is a faction that likes to block it completely except from a handful of hosts. Then there are those that like to leave it open all together.

    I have a love-hate feeling about &#8220;predictions&#8221; about the upcoming year, especially tech predictions. I don&#8217;t like media sensationalism of any kind, and a lot of the tech predctions are just that, sensational, extreme talk to draw in readers or viewers. I&#8217;m choosing to go down a more subtle path, these are things I&#8217;ve thought about lately but will likely forget in the upcoming year, unless they actually happen, in which case I&#8217;d likely do an &#8220;ah, I remember thinking that may happen&#8221; gesture.

    I am very happy and flattered that this site actually proves to be useful to folks. It was always my intention to use this as a platform to try to give back a bit, to help with any data I may have run across that was interesting, useful, or obscure. I utilize sites like etherialmind.com, packetpushers.net, evilrouters.net, networkstatic.net and ioshints more than I can even measure. I wanted to try to contribute as much as I could to pay it back.

    After reading Stephen Fosketts post &#8220;How Will Cisco Recover From The Consumer Strategy Blunder?&#8220;, it got me thinking. It&#8217;s a very different world than when Cisco got started all those years ago. I don&#8217;t have any brand loyalty to Cisco, I learned on cisco gear 14-15 years ago for the most part, but I try to keep the mentality of &#8220;the right tool for the job&#8221;, which means constantly surveying th emarket for new and interesting ways to do things.
