Mellanox is the primary source of switches that use its ASICs. Either that,
or its list of ASIC customers is very tightly held. HPE (Hewlett Packard) does
resell these as m-series switches. The switches were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/mellanox-PR.pdf">
announced in a press release</a> that hearlded the SN3000 family without listing
its members. A follow-on document in September 2019 is a lot closer to a real
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/BR_SN3000_Series.pdf">data sheet</a>.

The Spectrum-2 ASIC is capable of PAM4 encoding on each lane, so QSFP56 and 400 Gb/s in a QSFP-DD 8-lane receptacle.

The ASIC claims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/WP_Real-time_Network_Visibility.pdf">fine grained buffer statistics</a> with 64 nS interval resolution.
The linked white paper was written along with the ASIC introduction in 2017 and a careful reading suggests 
it may not be entirely accurate. But it's the intent that counts??
