<p>Nick: Thanks for taking the time to write about OpenDaylight. One thing I did want to clarify is that onePK is not part of the Project or part of our contribution. The code we did contribute was the Service Abstraction Layer and App Framework from our ONE Controller, but those pieces are not built with or rely on onePK. Regards, Omar (@omarsultan) Cisco

<p>Thanks, Omar! Great point, I was a tad off in my understanding and articulation of that. Thanks for the clarification, I see great potential in this project.
