So, much of this has started to work better now that the service has been available for a while. I can now message a phone number via my ipad, and it pops up on my phone and ipad, however, when someone sends me and iMessage, I only see it on my iPhone for sure. I have yet to be able to ascertain what the criteria is for popping up on both my iPad and iPhone.
