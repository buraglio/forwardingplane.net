        Many network engineers are also tasked with maintaining systems that provide network services, those things that make the network easier to use such as DNS and DHCP or management systems that perform useful things like monitor the network, collect flow data or bestow access to the equipment by acting as bastion or jump hosts. In many instances, robust and high availability services run on UNIX, Linux or BSD systems for stability and reliability, so those that manage these systems need to be well versed system admins as well as whatever their other job functions are.

        Many regular internet users are extremely upset about the recent proposed changes the FCC has opened for comments about the delivery and provisioning of internet services. Watch this video if you&#8217;re unaware of the high emotions it has evoked:
While these are proposed rules and are not in any way finalized, there is real concern that they may become law. Where this is problematic is that it opens up the possibility of some real misuse, abuse or simple misunderstanding of needs and services.

        I don&#8217;t care what your vendor alignment of choice is, Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, Alcatel&#8230;.it doesn&#8217;t matter. At one point or another you&#8217;re going to need to bird dog an address to see where it&#8217;s coming from, who owns it, what it&#8217;s DNS name is or what path you&#8217;re taking to get to it. We&#8217;ve already talked about BGP tools, they&#8217;re a great choice for checking routes across the internet. Hunting down addresses is an interesting one, though, as address management and lookups can bleed into other aspects of networking like path selection, latency, jitter and many other things.

        With the recent announcement of Cisco Systems intent to purchase tail-f, proponents of a multi-vendor environment are waiting with baited breath to see how the networking giant will deal with support of competitor hardware and CLIs.
Yang is here to stay, there is no doubt about that. As is netconf. Both of these are good things for the industry as a whole, having a standard way to communicate with network hardware [that isn&#8217;t openflow] is necessary and immeasurably useful.

        IP addressing and subnetting is a common interview subject. I assert that memorizing these things is useful for learning the concepts but ultimately futile in that it is time consuming and inefficient use of engineering time when tools can be utilized to accomplish the same goals in less time with fewer errors. Honestly, I gave up doing this kind of work manually around 10 years ago and have never regretted it, and in actuality, I&#8217;d probably struggle to do it at this point because it&#8217;s a repetitive process better suited by code.

        I&#8217;ve blathered on about BGP forever. Say what you will about the venerable protocol, it runs the interwebs, is reliable, extendable and well documented. I&#8217;ve also espoused ad nauseam about IPv6, so none of this [admitted] rant should really be a surprise coming from me.
As of 8/12/2014, according to the CIRD report (and many mailing lists), the default free global ipv4 routing table has reached 512k routes. This is a milestone from many perspectives, but more importantly, it solidifies the fact that there is a great deal of equipment in critical points in the internet that is out of date and cannot perform as intended in its current configuration or function.

        I admit that the title was meant to be inflammatory. However, there are use cases that aren&#8217;t terribly uncommon where an in-line security appliance is just not the correct tool for the job. Someone once told me &#8220;a firewall protects a network like a fuse protects an electrical circuit&#8221;, and it&#8217;s mostly a correct statement.
Firewall vendors will probably argue this and enterprise folks may discount this as heresy and call for burning me at the stake.

        I know, I know, I&#8217;m always saying that you don&#8217;t need a firewall. That&#8217;s mostly to get your attention to push my agenda of sane security architecture, I do actually believe that firewalls are appropriate in a great many use cases and I&#8217;ve managed them big and small ranging from Juniper SRX 5800 clusters to tiny purpose built BSD distros on custom hardware. I even managed Checkpoint and gauntlet firewall back in the 1990s.

        I was recently granted access to the beta BigSwitch Networks lab site, a purpose built classroom in the cloud focused on teaching the BigSwitch SDN environment. I had seen some of the BSN offerings in the past and always held them in high regard, but I was thoroughly impressed with both the completeness of the lab and how polished the controller environment was.At the time of this writing, the lab consists of 3 modules: Building cloud fabric, monitoring fabric and dynamic provisioning of monitoring fabric.

        I was wanting to do a few quick mock-ups with OpenvSwitch and OpenDayLight and wanted to use CentOS since I have templates for it that I replicate. Just like with the debian stuff I had been doing, I wasn&#8217;t able to find any in some quick searches. I stumbled upon This site, which had a great how to for building them, so I just used that. Seeing as that the debian packages actually got downloaded a lot, I figured I&#8217;d post these RPMs as well.
