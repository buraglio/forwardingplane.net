In the second part of the model number:
<ul>
<li><b>C</b> means 100 Gb/s QSFP port</li>
<li><b>Y</b> means 25 Gb/s SFP port</li>
<li><b>Z</b> means multispeed tw-pr ports</li>
<li>No letter means 1 Gb/s Tw-pr port</li>
</ul>
<p>

Michael Francini from Arista said something about the
packet processor for this switch in an introductory youtube video.
https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBY0DfQandQ?rel=0&wmode;=transparent.
Unfortunately when he talked about the packet processor he could
have said X3 or XP -- since they sound very much the same when
spoken. As an update to this description [Nov 2021] this is
a Trident X3 and that matches the buffer size in the datasheet.
An early [2019] version of the datasheet says the packet buffer size
is 6 MB, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010612/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/CCS-720XP-Datasheet-2021.pdf">
 current version</a> says 8 MB.
<p>
To add the overall picture, the X3 has stacking ports. And ASICs
with stacking ports allocate buffer to serve the stack. Sometimes
the stack ports can be disabled and their buffer reclaimed. Broadcom
and Arista are not explaining this.
<p>
The detailed port characteristics of each model are slightly confusing
and the best reference is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010612/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/CCS-720XP-Datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a>.
Most tw-pr ports have 30W PoE, but some have 60 W PoE, and this is
not reflected in the model number. And most tw-pr mGig ports top
at 2.5 Gb/s but some can run at 5 Gb/s.
