<h2>Dell S5148</h2>

As noted in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010705/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/dell-5148.pdf">announcement</a> this is something new.
We have not seen a data sheet. It might be a Tomahawk. Or it might be something else.
A NetworkWorld article says that Dell expects these to ship before the end of October
with a starting price of $22,000.
<p>
Re-introduced in October 2017, but still no data sheet. The programmability in the 
feature list below suggests this might be a Cavium ASIC. The S5148 and S5048 are
speeds-and-feeds identical. The announced difference is that S5048 uses Dell's OS9
while the S5148 uses OS10.
<p>
<b>Features specifically for the S5148</b>
<ul>
<li>1RU high-density 25/10/1 GbE ToR switch with up to forty eight ports of native 25 GbE (SFP28) ports supporting 25 GbE without breakout cables

</ul>
The press release projects availability in the quarter ending on November 3, 2017. Dell calls this the third quarter of 2018. 
We will see.

<i>Serverthehome</i> has done a teardown review of this switch on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010705/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHipTq2sitA&amp;t=0s"> youtube</a>.
The switch chip is a Cavium Xpliant. The management prosessor is an intel C2000 Atom. The review notes that because of the Cavium
prossesor Sonic and Cumulus have not been ported to this switch.
