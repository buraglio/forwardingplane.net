These switches are members of a family that use Mellanox's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/switchX.pdf">SwitchX</a> silicon
that was introduced in a press release on April 25, 2011. This silicon
permits mixing Ethernet, Infiniband and Fiber Channel ports in the same
device. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/15/mellanox_switchx_2_sdn_openflow/">SwitchX-2</a> 
was introduced in October 2012. Amit Katz gave an 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/http://www.mellanox.com/webinars/2012/sdn/sdn_thank_you.php">
introductory web presentation</a> in 2012. In Q&A; following the presentation,
Katz was asked what, exactly, is the difference between X and X-2. What
Mellanox was willing to say is that X-2 has enhanced microcode that makes
better use of internal tables to permit OpenFlow 1.3 to work better.
<p>
Mellanox had a substantial presence at the Ethernet Summit in May 2014. This 
is <b>not</b> yet another Broadcom top of rack switch. Mellanox has
expertise both as a silicon ASIC manufacturer and as a switch manufacturer. They 
point out that the speed of a single switch is only part of the speed of
a <i>system</i>. To the extent that increased port count lets you reduce
chassis count, you can get a big boost in system performance by traversing,
on average, fewer switches. And in a pure Mellanox data center, inter-switch
links can be kicked up to 56 Gb/s -- not a standard, but a substantial
increment over 40 Gb/s.
<p>
Latency is important for the data center and would
also be important for HPC clusters. It is not important in the WAN.
Mellanox ASICs were developed for Infiniband and enhanced so a single
switch chip part could be programmatically set up for either Infinband
or Ethernet. Perhaps because of its Infiniband roots, the chip is not
a shared memory design. Each port has its own buffers and there is no
common pool or sharing. Long RTT networks need large packet memory that is
available to buffer bursts. 
<p>
Mellanox hired Tolly to do 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/http://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/products/Tolly212113MellanoxSwitchSXPerformance.pdf"> performance report</a> #212113 on their Ethernet
products in May 2012. Tolly's <i>fair testing</i> charter not
withstanding, he tests only the parameters commisioned by his patron.
While Tolly reports for other similar products have highlighted the 
ability to deal with <i>microbursts</i>, buffer capabilities are not
even whispered for Mellanox. And Mellanox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/PB_SX1024.pdf">SX1024</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/sx1036.pdf">SX1036</a> 
data sheets do not contain
information about packet memory or buffer depth. We are greatful to
Amit Katz for proving the buffer sizes in the table via email: 128 KB
for 40/56 Gb/s ports and 64 KB for SFP+ ports.
<p>
In Februrary 2015 Mellanox commissioned a another Tolly performance report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Tolly-215111-Mellanox-SwitchX-2_Performance.pdf">215111</a> 
to emphasize their <i>bone fides</i> relative to the Broadcom Trident2
switch ASICs. Mellanox claims the evidence shows that Broadcom cut-thru mode
is only available when all ports are running at a common speed. When the
ASIC is called upon to do a speed conversion, Broadcom shifts out of
cut-thru mode. While the first Tolly report came out ahead of the SwitchX-2
announcement, the later report says it represents performance with the
newer ASIC. Indeed, while the model number remains SX1036, part numbers
changed between X and X-2. While the new data sheet carries the new part
number, no additional information about buffer details has been provided.
Mellanox claims switchX-2 is able to maintain cut-thru mode in
the face of speed matching.
<p>
Mellanox switches are ripping fast. They are undoubtedly the right
choice for many applications. If your application needs WAN-sized
buffers, SX switches will not, however, be your choice.
