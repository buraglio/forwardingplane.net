<p>Hi Nick, I&rsquo;m not a WAN routing guy so this may be a ridiculous question but I&rsquo;m curious how you would compare/contrast segment routing with shortest path bridging. From the little I know, the goals seem awfully similar.

<p>At face value they are very close. So much so, that I was literally doing a direct comparison over the last month or so for some other projects. The biggest differences I see between them is scale out and incumbent knowledge. I struggled to find someone doing SPB in the WAN (they exist, but there don&rsquo;t seem to be many). SR leverages a common skill set: ISIS and Labels, both of which are very common in the SP world. It builds on that while at the same time simplifying it. Scaling out ISIDs and bridge paths is great, and I definitely see a use case, but realistically speaking, the support is lackluster across the vendor space whereas SR has pretty robust support from the likes of Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Alcatel-Lucent (Nokia), etc. SPB also really touts multicast support and segmentation as a big part of its core competency, which I don&rsquo;t care about so much anymore. There are also the odd governing body intricacies that have some part in this as well, but that&rsquo;s more political than I really want to pay attention to. At the end of the day my gut says SPB has more of a place in the campus or data center and SR has its feet firmly planted in service providers with a hand in large campuses.

 mood of the boss, etc.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to get to spend some quality time at a <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/srr1/">special event</a> recently. Interesting discussions were had, many a thing was learned. A few of the other attendees wrote up some great info on segment routing, including some use cases, which can be found here</p>

<p>I highly recommend taking a view of the talks from some folks using SR on some pretty significant networks - it&rsquo;s worth your time if you&rsquo;re really interested in throwing down with segment routing.  But what did this tell <strong><em>me</em></strong>? Lets look further into SR and see why it&rsquo;s become so attractive to large, geographically diverse networks. First, SR builds on an existing knowledgeable. Far more people exist in the market that already know MPLS. The understand labels, they understand overlays, and they have vast experience with virtual circuits. Service providers are very likely MPLS based if they operate at any scale and offer typical ISP services. MPLS is well traveled, and even though there may be reasons that&rsquo;s not perfect, it&rsquo;s the devil we know. Other SDN technologies are either fairly green (l<a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/12/running-open-daylight-in-production.html#more">et me tell you about running a production openflow experience</a>) or are primarily focused on the data center, which as I will adamantly insist is a very different beast.</p>

<p>Large scale service providers have a very different redundancy model. Attempting to apply campus or enterprise redundancy to a service provider does not scale and it certainly isn&rsquo;t affordable. SR leverages the same models that MPLS does, it realies heavily on the IGP, leveraging a TLV within IS-IS. That brings me to IS-IS. Most service providers leverage IS-IS as their internal gateway protocol due to it&rsquo;s ability to carry multiple routed protocols at once, leverage multi-topology, and the fact that it does not rely on the protocol it is routing for connectivity like OSPF does. SR is more-or-less an extension to IS-IS. Overlapping skill set #2. The other option, and this is a big one, is that there are multiple vendors that supported, as stated above. This is a big deal as int provides that &ldquo;throat to choke&rdquo; that a lot of emerging technologies just do not really have yet.</p>

<p>Did I mention that it &ldquo;fails open”? What’s not to love about falling back to an IGP rather than ceasing to process packets?  Lets do a for-instance use-case. Within your SR network you provision a path that takes a path with more hops but has less congestion. Create your label stack and away you go* Of that path fails, the traffic falls back to the standard routing table.</p>

<p>Much like MPLS (of which I am a fan, FWIW), this technology is better suited for a larger network with multiple paths, this could be any number of  environments such as large camps networks, large scale data centers geographically diverse environments connected by multiple WAN circuits, and of course, service and content providers. This tech is quite simply full of win. </p>
