<b>Nexus 3048 ~ N3K-C3048TP-1GE</b>
<ul>
The Nexus 3048 (48x 10/100/1000 with 4 x 10G) is a Trident+ based switch, with 9MB of
buffer (just like the approved F10 S4810). This has been successfully deployed in Hong
Kong for ISIS 7500 (without Avid approval), for a limited number of clients at less than 50%
population for Avid clients. However this .artificially limited. device may have a limited
lifetime as it is based on legacy merchant silicon.

While it is a surprise to see a 10 Gb/s ASIC used in a 1 Gb/s application,
there is no reason it shouldn't work.
