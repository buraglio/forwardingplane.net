<h2>Extreme Networks VSP8600</h2>

<p>
<b>Introduced Sept 2017</b>
<p>
ExtremeNetworks got this switch as part of the Avaya purchase that closed in July 2017. 
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010602/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/VSP-8600-series.pdf"> data sheet</a> is remarkably thin on details. What we know is:
<blockquote>
<li>8 interface module slots
<li>Speed and feeds
<ul>
<li> 6 x 100 Gb/s QSP28
<li> 16 x 40 Gb/s QSP
<li> 24 x 10 Gb/s SFP+
<li> 24 x 10 Gb/s Twisted Pair
</ul>
<li>3 fabric slots
<li>Fabric BW is 7.2 Tb/s per module
<li>Uses merchant silicon of unannounced origin
<li>IPv6 support not available at first ship
</blockquote>
What we don't know is:
<blockquote>
<li> Size of packet buffers
<li> Is switch fabric crossbar or something different?
<li> Forwarding latency
</blockquote>
<b>Packet memory claims</b> in the data sheet are nonspecific:
<blockquote>
<i>To this end,
the VSP 8600’s architecture features deep packet buffers
that accommodate bursty traffic and deliver lossless
performance.</i>
</blockquote>
So, here is some speculation. Introduced at the same time, the VSP8400 is built on Broadcom. It would
save engineering resources if the development team stayed within a single merchant family.
There are no published specifications that would rule out Jericho. Or it could use Jericho+ 
based on the date of introduction.
