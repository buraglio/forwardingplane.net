With the recent release of the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POODLE SSLv3 vulnerability</a>, folks are scrambling around trying to figure out what runs what and where.  Running a handful of things that do SSL, I was obligated, both personally and professionally, to figure out an easy way to drill down and figure out what does what and then fix the vulnerable services.  When there are a lot of devices, this can seem like a daunting task, and it is if you're trying to do it manually.  This is where <a href="http://nmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NMAP</a> comes into play.  NMAP is an extremely powerful tool for scanning and enumerating your own network, not just a tool for the script kiddies to port scan.
Since there is no SSL patch at the time of this writing, and since SSLv3 is old and depricated, it is a good idea to see what services support it and then squish them in favor of TLS 1+.  Thankfully, smarter folks than myself have done most of the legwork for accomplishing this task and written most of it down <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. NMAP has a wealth of cool scripts and bolt ons that extend it in amazing ways.  To accomplish our tasks we'll ned to do a few things.
Install nmap. I ran into issues with the <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nselibs</a> being incomplete, so I grabbed the source and built it that way as opposed to using yum.
<pre>git clone git@github.com:nmap/nmap.git</pre>
We then need to build it from source which requires the dev tools:
<pre>sudo yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'
cd nmap
./configure
sudo make</pre>
and alternatively
<pre>sudo make install</pre>
I like to just run it from my directory since there are path considerations.
<pre>(~/nmap) v-chimera $ ./nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 10.14.14.0/27

From here we can see that there is a host that needs to be updated. There are a wealth of docs out there for changing out the supported version. Most of my stuff is apache so I used <a href="https://zmap.io/sslv3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this guide</a>. For embedded devices, the best option is to filter access [which you should probably be doing anyway] until there is a patched firmware version.
