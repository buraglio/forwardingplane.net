    <div class="content"> <p>Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The SDN sites are all abuzz with talk about how your enterprise network can take advantage of the deluge of new products and services out there aimed at that market, and that&rsquo;s great - there are some cool options out there for that space. But, like I always do, I want to talk about the other pieces that most people do not see. The gritty plumbing and complex interconnections of the last mile providers, because there are a lot of very interesting moving parts there that the typical data center engineers don&rsquo;t see, care about, or perhaps even know exist. In the past I&rsquo;ve touched on things like <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2016/10/care-segment-routing/">Segment Routing</a> and how it plays into the complex ISP world. This is really just the surface.</p>
