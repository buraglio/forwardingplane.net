<p>
What does <i>Up to</i> mean? Does it mean 8 MB per core and up to four
cores per switch SKU? Slide is from a BRKARC-3467 talk in June 2017.
I think it means 16 MB per slice (32 MB total) for UADP-2.XL and
8 MB per slice for UADP-2.0. 
<p>
25 percent of the buffer is allocated to the ring connection. So
buffer available for burst absorption is ~10 MB per slice for the <b>XL</b>
and ~5 MB per slice for <b>UADP-2.0</b>.
