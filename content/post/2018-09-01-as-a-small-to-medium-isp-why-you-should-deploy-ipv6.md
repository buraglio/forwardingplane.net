IPv6 has been a crusade of mine for well over a decade. Wether it is teaching IPv6 workshops, offering advice to new users, answering questions, or evangelizing it ad nauseam, it is an important topic to me. The ISP world holds a special place in my heart since a good deal of my early experience came from building or assisting regional ISPs. Recently I had a fun opportunity to talk about deploying IPv6 on <a href="http://thebrotherswisp.com/">The Brothers WISP podcast</a>.
This was a really fun experience, and if you're looking at deploying v6, take a listen (or watch) to this - it should give you the basics or at the very least a place to start.
