<h2>Marvell CX switch ASICs</h2>
<p>
This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010731/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/marvell-switching-prestera-98cx8500-product-brief-2019-03.pdf">
product brief</a> from March 2019 has good info about current Marvell ASICs.
It appears they have lots of features. Marvell, however, does not disclose
packet buffer sizes except in the most general terms like <i>2x packet
capacity over available solutions in the market.</i> These parts are built
using 16 nm features -- which seems about right for products introduced in
2019.
<p>
Marvell has several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010731/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/marvell-telemetry-white-paper-2018-03.pdf">
white papers</a> that discuss fine grained measurements of network performance.
<p>
While I can find info on Marvell ASICs (but not buffer size), I am still
searching for products that actually use their parts. Marvell makes some
switches for their ASICs:
<ul>
<li>Marvell RD-BC3-4825G6CG-A4 Marvell Prestera 98CX84xx 6x100G+48x25G 
<li>Marvell RD-ARM-48XG6CG-A4 Marvell Prestera 98EX54xx 6x100G+48x10G 
</ul>
Some Marvell-based switches are manufactured by Edgecore but their
datasheets do not list packet buffer memory. Two Juniper switches use
Marvell CX 8248 which was introduced in 2010. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010731/http://isp-tech.ru/en/switch-asic/">
isp-tech.ru/en/switch-asic/</a> has a short application note that says the ASICs have
4 MB buffers and that the Juniper EX4500-40F and EX4550-32F have two ASICs.
