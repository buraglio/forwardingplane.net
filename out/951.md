OpenFlow is a game changer, no question about it. With all of the buzz about it, I really don't think we're seeing past its real value, most are focusing on the data center and potentially not seeing the forest for the trees.  I don't really care about the gooey center of the data center. I've built, maintained, consulted on or in some way supported so many HPC data centers in the last 12 years that I find them dull at this point\*.         \*With the exception of the [Blue Waters petascale machine](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/bluewaters).  BW has pushed limits of networking, security and computing at every opportunity.
