I found most of this on a web page somewhere tha tI can't seem to find again. Below are some common useful junos tidbits regarding routing tables and interface types/names:  
  
JunOS CLI supports the basic grep command (like | include) so any show commands can be grepped. I believe the grep command implies the -i flag for case insensitivity.  
  
The routing table is presented in such a way to group types of routes.  
  
**inet.0 is the ipv4 unicast routing table  
  
**

**inet.1 is the ipv4 multicast routing table  
  
**

**inet.3 is the MPLS routing table  
  
**

**inet6.0 is the ipv6 routing table**  
  
  
Juniper interface types  
  
  
Most common ones you'll probably see:  
  
**fe: Fast Ethernet 100Base-TX (Fast Ethernet, 100 Mbps).  
  
fxp0: Management and internal Ethernet The management Ethernet interface is an out-of-band management interface within the routing platform.  
  
fxp1: Interface that connects the routing engine and packet forwarding engine.  
  
xe: 1GE optical interface on ex switches  
  
ge: Gigabit and 10gigabit Ethernet. Includes Gigabit Ethernet IQ interfaces.  
  
me0: - out of band management interface on ex switches  
  
lo: Loopback This interface is internally generated. The logical interface lo0.16383 is a non-configurable interface for routing platform control traffic.  
  
vcp: - virtual chassis interface (EX4200 only)  
  
Other ones you may run into:  
  
ae: Aggregated Ethernet A virtual aggregated link.  
  
**

**

**ct3: Channelized T3 IQ Configured on the Channelized DS-3 IQ PIC or Channelized OC-12 IQ PIC.  
  
**

**cp: Collector Configured on the Monitoring Services II PIC.  
  
**

**ds: DS-0 Configured on the Channelized DS-3 to DS-0 PIC, Channelized E1 PIC, Channelized OC-12 IQ PIC,  
  
**

**dsc: Discard Allows you to identify the ingress point of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  
  
**

**e1: E1 Includes the channelized STM-1 to E1 interfaces.  
  
**

**e3: E3 Includes the E3 IQ interfaces.  
  
**

**es: Encryption, Allows you to configure a security association (SA) name with a logical interface.

**

**ls: Link services Supports bundles that contain links.  
  
**

**lsi: Internally generated This interface is internally generated and is not configurable.  
  
**

**ml: Multilink Includes Multilink Frame Relay and Multilink PPP.  
  
**

**mo: Monitoring services Includes the monitoring services and monitoring services  
II interfaces: The logical interface mo-fpc/pic/port.16383 is an internally generated, non-configurable interface for routing platform control traffic.  
  
**

**mt: Multicast tunnel Internal routing platform interface for VPNs.  
  
**

**mtun: Internally generated This interface is internally generated and is not configurable.  
  
**

**oc3: OC-3 IQ Configured on the Channelized OC-12 IQ PIC.  
  
**

**pe: This interface is present on the first-hop routing platform. Encapsulates packets destined for the rendezvous point (RP) routing platform.  
  
**

**pd: This interface is present on the RP De-encapsulates packets at the RP.  
  
**

**pimd: Internally generated This interface is internally generated and is not configurable.  
  
**

**pime: Internally generated This interface is internally generated and is not configurable.  
  
**

**rlsq: - a redundant bundle interface, made of two or more lsq interface. If you have redundant AS Pics.  
  
**

**se: Serial Includes the EIA-530, V.35, and X.21 interfaces.  
  
**

**so: SONET/SDH Both are widely used methods for very high speed transmission of voice and data signals across the numerous world-wide fiber-optic networks.  
  
**

**sp: Adaptive services The logical interface sp-fpc/pic/port.16383 is an internally generated, non-configurable interface for routing platform control traffic.  
  
**

**

**vsp: Voice services, The Adaptive Services (AS) Physical Interface Card (PIC) supports the compressed real-time transport protocol (RTP) on this interface.  
  
**

**vt: Virtual loopback tunnel On routing platforms equipped with a Tunnel PIC, enables egress filtering.  
**  
Other interesting terminology regarding the juniper architecture is the module layout:  
  
**RE: Routing Engine, Like a cisco supervisor module. Central brains of the system  
  
**

**PFE: Packet forwarding Engine. Controls the data packet forwarding of the system.  
  
**

**SCB: Switch control board. Contains ASICs that handle route lookups and memory management.  
  
**

**PIC: Physical interface card. Sort of like a port, but can contain multiple interfaces.  
  
**

**FPC: Flexible PIC concentrator. Like a linecard that has module slots. Can handle different types of PICs**
