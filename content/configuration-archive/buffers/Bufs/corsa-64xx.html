<h2>Corsa 6630 and 6640 Open Flow Switches</h2>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010638im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/corsa-diagram.PNG">
<p>
Corsa products emerged in ~june 2014. Corsa is a new company anchored 
in Ottowa that had a successful round B financing. If you count on your 
network company to have data sheets with data on them -- stop reading 
now. Common features like size, weight, power consumption are not 
listed. But perhaps anyone concerned with that minutia needs more 
hand holding than comes with OpenFlow SDN.
<p>
<b>Most important</b> This is an SDN switch data plane. An OpenFlow
controller will be needed running e.g. a routing application to make
it look like a network switch.
<p>
The diagram above was snatched from an EtherRealMind 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010638/http://etherealmind.com/briefing-corsa-networks/">blog post</a> in June 2014.
What seems clear is that Corsa products are built from FPGA (field programmable
gate arrays) stitched together to make a flexible pipeline architecture.
Current product uses 28 nM silicon technology.  The switches are 
targetted at the WAN switch market as evidenced by the deep buffers 
and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010638/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/corsa-metering-qos.pdf">application report<a> 
on WAN buffering.
<p>
A note on the data sheet says that Corsa is not in the transceiver business
and their switches will accept CFP2 and SFP+ transceivers that comply with
MSA requirements, independent of source.
<p>
Corsa also makes 10G/40G products (DP6610 and DP6620).
Corsa gives an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010638/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/corsa-Product-Overview.pdf"> overview of switches.</a>
Even better, CTO Kumar from Corsa gave a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010638/https://meetings.internet2.edu/2015-technology-exchange/detail/10003931/">talk</a> at the October 2015 Internet2 tech exchange. You should separately
download the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010638/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/corsa-kumar-talk.pdf">slides<a> because you'll 
want to see them in higher-than-webinar resolution.
