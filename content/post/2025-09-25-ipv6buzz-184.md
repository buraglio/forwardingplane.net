We’re diving into another IPv6 Basics today with the topic of dual-stack, which means running the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously. We get many questions about the implications of running dual-stack, and in this episode we’ll provide answers. We start by getting a little finicky about the definition of dual-stack, and then talk about when you should be using it, the impacts dual-stack may have on your network design, and how to think about dual-stack as a transition to an all (or mostly) IPv6 environment. We also touch on CLAT, which provides v4 connectivity across a v6 network.
