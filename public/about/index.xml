      <description>This siteÂ is maintained by the domain owner, me, Nick Buraglio. It is intended to be a journal and notebook for things I find useful, problems I&amp;rsquo;m working on or general technology rambling.  It should be noted, however, that these pages are really just a personal notebook to me, stuff I find useful and things I may want to remember. Please don&amp;rsquo;t expect them to always be correct or complete .</description>
