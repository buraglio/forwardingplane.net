Introduced in Summer of 2013. It is the successor to the 2960S that 
was introduced in 2010. Cisco claims that packet memory has been
doubled. The block diagram shows a single buffer pool across all
ports. 
<p>
Information on the 2960S is somewhat harder to find. Pictures of
the switch circuit board show two ASICs in the 48 port model and
one ASIC in the 24 port model. It may be that the 2 MB of packet
memory is actually two 1 MB pools. In any case, the new 2960-X has
more. It is likely that some of the memory is dedicated to the 
stacking ports. Details on how much memory is in the dynamic pool
available to payload packets is not known.
