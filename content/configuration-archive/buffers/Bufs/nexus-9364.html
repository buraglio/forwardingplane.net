<b>Introduced July 2017</b>
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010725/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/9364C.pdf">This switch</a> and its smaller cousin the <b>9332C</b> are a one year later follow-on to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010725/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/nexus-93180.html"><b>nexus 93180YC-EX</b></a>. 
The switch ASIC is <b>S6400</b>.

<p>
The total buffer size is the same as the 93180YC-EX but it is carved into four slices to get
the lookup performance required by the high count of 100 Gb/s ports.
What is not so clear is how the slices are interconnected. Best guess is
that there is some sort of crossbar switch. Each slice will need to dedicate
some of its buffers for the slice interconnects. That means that 10 MByte
per slice is probably not all available for burst absorption.
<p>
Marketing wise, Cisco seems to prefer <i>Cloud scale ASIC</i> over
<i>Leaf Spine Engine</i>. The architecture of this switch is covered
in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010725/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/BRKARC-3222.pdf"> BRKARC-3222</a>. That paper says the
switch is nonblocking, but that seems unlikely.
<p>
Speeds-and-feeds wise, the Nexus 9364 matches with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010725/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/C3264C-E.html">Nexus 3264</a>. The latter is a Broadcom
Tomahawk 2 product. Cisco is proud that their <i>Cloud scale ASIC</i> product made it to
market before the merchant silicon <i>Tomahawk 2</i>.
