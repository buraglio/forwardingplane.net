Like most network engineers that have been around long enough, I manage a handful of unix-like systems. As I have done work for service providers all over the place for the last 15 years, I have accumulated enough systems out there that need patched and maintained. I like to to send out a raspberry pi to as many ASNs as I can, enabling the poor-mans [NLNOG Ring](https://ring.nlnog.net/) that only I manage. I had been using ansible for simple tasks, but I wanted a little more control and was looking for a reason to tinker around with salt. Here I'll outline the most simpleÂ tasks of installing a master and a minion in order to accomplish some simple updates. For this endeavor, we'll need at least two systems: a master and a minion. The master should have reliable connectivity and a static IP address. I plan to use a VPS at prgmr.com as my master.
