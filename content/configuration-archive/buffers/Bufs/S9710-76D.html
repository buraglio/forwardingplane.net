There is not a lot of info on this switch. Where ufiSpace hangs the
datasheet for other switches, the cabinet is bare. On the far left
side of the picture, two small connectors are shown that are
typically used for IEEE1588 timing. These ports are not mentioned
in the feature list.  The switch is
part of the ufiSpace disaggregated chassis system. It is used
with the <b>S9705-48D</b> fabric switch to build systems. Interconnects
between the leaf switches and the fabric can be copper or fiber QSFP-DD.
