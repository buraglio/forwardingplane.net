Dell introduced the 8100 series switches in 2012.
With persistence, it is possible to find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010551/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/dell-release-notes.pdf">
release notes</a> and manuals on Dell's web site. Dell has developed code for 
their Trident+ switches that automatically finds ports hooked to 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010551/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/EqualLogic.pdf">Equilogic file server</a> equipment and configures 
it for reliable FCoE type service. The implementation includes
both 802.3X flow control and 802.1Qbb Priority flow control.

<h2>N4000 family</h2>
<p>
Dell is killing off the PowerConnect line in favor of the "S" series for the data center and the "N" series for everything else. 
The N4000 had its press release debut in December 2013 with initial product shipments in Q1 2014.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010551/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/N4000-specs.pdf">data sheet</a> for the new N4000 series switches are very similar to the 8100. The sheet metal seems identical. There are some small differences in e.g. the number of static routes.

See the entry for the Cisco 3064. Introduced as 3064PQ, it was upgraded to the 3064X. There is a whiff of an underlying Broadcom chip revision that caused the 3064PQ to go away. The same sort of small change may be at play here, too.
