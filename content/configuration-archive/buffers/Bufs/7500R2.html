<h2>Arista 7500R2M-36CQ Line Card</h2>
<p>
7500R and 7500R2 are respectively <b>Jericho</b> and <b>Jericho+</b> based products. The ASICs have
both on-chip and off-chip storage for packet buffers. In both cases, Arista has equipped
each packet processor with 4 GBytes. The default maximum buffer for any queue is 5 mS,
so 62 MByte.  The default max is set to put an upper bound on delay through the switch.
This parameter is adjustable.  Because queuing is on input, each packet process has its own 4 GByte pool.
The Jericho+ ASIC is more capable than its predecessor so fewer are needed per line
card. The <i>7500Rs</i> therefore has a lower count of ASICs and therefore less total
buffer. 
<p>
There are varients of this card with more route memory, but all with 4 GB of packet
storage. The <b>R2</b> has other feature differences like algomatch that are unrelated
to buffer size.  The block diagram of the subject card is:
