**Podcasts**

Podcasts on Security and Networking that I have hosted or participated in. The series hosted by myself for ForwardingPlane.net are "Default Deny" and "Non-Blocking", which focus on data networking and security, respectively. \[soundcloud url="https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242625484" params="auto\_play=false&hide\_related=false&show\_comments=true&show\_user=true&show\_reposts=false&visual=true" width="100%" height="150" iframe="true" /\]
