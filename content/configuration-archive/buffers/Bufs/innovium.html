<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/http://innovium.com/">Innovium</a> Teralynx 7</h2>
<p>
Public announcement date: <b>March 14, 2017</b>
<p>
A family of chips aimed at the data center with hopes of eating Broadcom's
lunch.  New high watermark with 70 MB buffer on-chip
packet memory. This is just an announcement -- no product yet.
<p>
There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Innovium-Whitepaper.pdf"> white paper</a>. And there 
is a a PR-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/innovium.pdf">trade magazine article</a>. 
<p>
To get 128 QSFP28 ports requires either 512 SERDES or 256 SERDES and an
appropriate <b>gearbox</b> to split a single 50 G PAM4 lane into two 25 G NRZ
lanes. These devices are made by Inphi.
<p>
<h2>March 22, 2018 update</h2>
<p>
Innovium presented a slide at the 2018 OpenCompute Summit announcing
that the milestone of <i>sampling</i> had been reached.
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/innovium-update.png" alt="trade show slide">
<p>
<p>
At this point, samples will be sent to qualified manufacturers who will
prototype and build products. So, nothing that can be ordered. I asked
on the OpenCompute show floor
whether the buffer was a single unified pool. Answer: you need to sign
a non-disclosure to find out. Innovium claims that the Teralynx latency
is the best in the industry. Tomahawk 3 is specified by several of
their OEMs [e.g. Arista] as 700 nS. Cisco clocks their 3432D Teralyx as 370 nS.
With that performance, it is unlikely that the Teralynx has a 
slice architecture.
<p>
There are momma bear, papa bear, baby bear versions of the Teralynx 7 ASIC:

Teralynx was the top dog switch at 12.8 Tb/s in the category of
vaporware. That ended with Broadcom's Tomahawk 3 announcement
at the end of 2017 because Broadcom was shipping samples to their
whitebox vendors. With Teralynx's March announcement, they are now
shipping as well.

<h2>May 2020 update</h2>
<p>
TERALYNX 8 Family Highlights
<ul> <li> Robust 112G SerDes IO with best economics for next-generation switches
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Range of pin-compatible SKU options, including 25.6 Tbps, 12.8 Tbps and 8Tbps
<li>Largest on-chip buffer of <b>170 MB</b> for a data-center switch
<li>Highest radix with 256 ports to help flatten network tiers
</ul></ul>
Innovium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Innovium_TL8.pdf">announced the Teralynx8</a> on April 29, 
2020. The chip has a 7 nm geometry. The smallest of the Teralynx 8 ASICs
(IVM88300) has a 114 MByte buffer.

<h2>April 2021 update</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/04/21/innovium-hitches-its-switches-to-sonics-boom/" < a> Article in The Next Platform</a> announces that innovium
has done a SONiC port for Teralynx. It appears that design wins for
Teralynx have been mostly private. Perhaps that will change. Innovium is
rumored to be used in AWS and confirmed at LinkedIn. There may be
ODM products aimed at second tier users, given the SONiC port.
Anyway, read the article.
