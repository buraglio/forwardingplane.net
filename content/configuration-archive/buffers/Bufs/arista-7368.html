Introduced <b>March 2019</b>
<p>
An 8-slot chassis with a heart of Tomahawk-3. There are three interface card varients.
<ul>
<li><b>7368-16C</b> 40 and 100 Gbps speeds on 16 ports
<li><b>7368-4D</b> QSFP-DD 400 Gb/s
<li><b>7368-4P</b> OSFP 400 Gb/s
</ul>
There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010547/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7368X4-Datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a>.
<p>
This is not a cookie cutter copy of the Facebook Minipack. Arista
has included gearbox ASICs on the 400 Gb/s line cards. Their purpose
is to retime signals degraded going through the backplane. So 400 G
in and 400 G out. They can also be used to support 200 G and 100 G.
The gearbox ASIC is not the same as in the Minipack -- details in
the individual writeups.
<p>
The Arista switch was <i>inspired</i> by the OCP Minipack submission.
It is not, itself, an OCP full submission.
