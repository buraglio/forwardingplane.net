The date on the data sheet is April 15, 2014. This is consistant with other Trident-II switches.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010630/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/pluribus_server-switch_datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a> claims 288,000 MAC addresses
while a new Tolly report [30 Aug 2016] makes a distinction between hardware and software hosted
MAC forwarding tables. Tolly does not get bored and do reports on 2 year old switches without
sponsorship. So Pluribus thinks this is a <b>big thing.</b> Pluribus does not make any buffer
claims for this switch, but other products introduced at the same time based on the Intel FM6000
have <i>up to</i> 100 G.
