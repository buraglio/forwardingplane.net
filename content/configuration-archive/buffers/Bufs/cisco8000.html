In a webcast event on December 12, 2019 that lasted over one hour, Cisco managed to sing high praises 
without disclosing any content of technical interest. The project was 5 years in
the making and cost $1B to develop.  Silicon One will be a family of ASICs, the
first of which is the Q100.  At Cisco Live! in Barcelona
at the end of January 2020 Lane Wigley talked in 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=BRKSPG-2280#/session/1561564052105001knIl">
breakout session BRKSPG-2280</a>
to describe the new product line and describe technical content. Some form of registration or club membership

Broadcom has ASIC families -- each tuned to its task in the network hierarchy.
Tomahawk is the least flexible where all effort has been given over to blinding
speed; Trident has more flexibility and programmability; Jericho has deep
buffers but less speed. Broadcom's crossbar element for the Jericho family
is <b>Ramon</b>, so yet another ASIC.  Cisco's <b>Silicon One</b> will do 
it all in a single architecture. The <b>Silicon One Q100</b> has 16 nm
feature size.
<p>
Jericho2 and Cisco's Q100 have in common that they both use HBM memory connected
to the switching ASIC at the chiplet level. This either improves speed or saves
power. Those are probably the same thing.  
All Broadcom switch ASICs dice packets into cells. The cells, typically about
256 Bytes, are moved to the output port where they are reassembled into packets.
This works well for cut-through switching. <b>Silicon One</b> moves packets through
the switch as <i>packets</i>. This has the advantage that there is no difference
between internal ports that connect to the interchip fabric elements and the panel
ports at the edge of the device that connect to the outside world.
<p>
Cut-through switching is of little use to routers. And the first use of Silicon One
is to build routers. We are promised that the Silicon One architecture is good for
everything and that it will pop up all over Cisco's products, perhaps with the
Q100 ASIC or perhaps with some other as yet unannounced ASIC.
<p>
In January 2020 Lawrence Wobker presenting at Tech Field Day disclosed the
packet memory of the Q100 ASIC is 8 GB of HBM.
<p>
At this writing [June 2020] there is no ordering guide and no pricing which
means that the products have not reached <i>general availability</i>. But soon.
<p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>
The 8201 and 8202 are on the February 2021 price list, so orderable.
New family members introduced in October 2020 using silicon with
7 nm features. <b>Q200</b> parts have HBM chiplet off-die memory
and are intended for routing. <b>Q200L</b> parts do not have off-die
memory and are intended for switching. Cisco has not disclosed
packet memory for Silicon One. They have said that it is <b>big</b>.
The following graphic shows ten family members. It first appeared in a Cisco blog:

<p>
The <b>G100</b> part was introduced March 11, 2021. Its distinguishing feature
is PAM4 SerDes that run at 112 Gb/s yielding 100 Gb/s lanes and 800 Gb/s 
QFP-DD interface speeds. There is a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/white-paper-sp-product-family.pdf"> white paper</a> that describes 
the parts that have been introduced as of March 2021.
<p>
<h2>Update 2 </h2>
Lane Wigley presented at Cisco Live <b>8000 Series Architecture - BRKSPG-2033</b> in March 2021. Still no word about on-chip
memory. But the HBM memory is either 4 GB or 8 GB depending on model.
<p>
<h2>Update 3 </h2>
In October 2021 the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/silicon-one-p100-processor-ds.pdf"> P100</a> 
member of the family was announced. It has 192 112G SerDes. Eight of the
SerDes lanes will support 800 Gb/s ports. As a stand-alone switch, it
has port totals of 19.2 Tb/s. As a line card element half the SerDes
are used internally toward the fabric, so 9.6 Tb/s to the ports. The family portrait
was re-issued:

Description of the internal packet buffer remains <i>Large, fully shared, on-die packet buffer</i>
without dislosure of the packet buffer size. Cisco does have an extensive paper
on Silicon One's buffer architecture. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/silicon-one-buffer.pdf"> 
http://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/silicon-one-buffer.pdf</a>. All the examples
of different types of buffer architecture not withstanding, it does not
give us the answer to the <i>how much buffer</i> question. It supports a
guess that the 7 nM parts have 100 Mbyte of packet buffer.
