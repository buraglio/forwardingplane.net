<h2>Catalyst 3550</h2>
<p>
Introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010738/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cat3550.png">December 2001</a>
<p>
It is now hard to find documentation on switches from the turn of
the century. If there were architecture deep dives for this switch,
they are gone now.  A discussion of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010738/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Sw-buffer-size.pdf">
switch buffer sizes</a> makes it clear that at the time such
info was considered proprietary. The answer for the Catalyst
3550 appears to be 2 MByte. What is not clear is whether the
3550 buffer was organized as packet or particle buffers. That
makes a big difference in the effective buffering capability.  
The 3550 was a revolutionary 
introduction. It is a follow-on to the Catalyst 3500XL family and
the first to be able to merge L2 and L3 into an edge product.
At introduction, it was a 10/100 Mb/s switch with 1 Gig uplinks.
That permitted switching to be done in a single port ASIC.
Some details along with buffer size are in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010738/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/3550-datasheet.PDF">data sheet.</a>
<p>
A switch diagram from a 2003 Networkers slide deck shows
the shared memory architecture. Packet payloads go into the
shared memory while header info needed for routing is stored
in SRAM. <i>Satellite</i> refers to the port ASIC [Satellite ASIC].
Shared memory is <i>off chip</i>.

QOS Review</a>:
<ul>
<b>Queue Size Configuration on Gigabit Ports</b>
<p>
The 3550 switch uses central buffering. This means that there are no 
fixed buffer sizes per port. However, there is a fixed number of 
packets on a Gigabit port that can be queued. This fixed number is 
4096. By default, each queue in a Gigabit port can have up to 1024 
packets, regardless of the packet size. However, you can modify 
the way in which these 4096 packets are split among the four queues. 
<p>
<b>Queue Management and Queue Size on Non-Gigabit Ports</b>
<p>
There is no queue management scheme available on 10/100-Mbps ports 
(no WRED or tail drop with two thresholds). All four queues are 
FIFO queues. There is also no maximum queue size that reserves 
4096 packets for each Gigabit port. 10/100-Mbps ports store 
packets in each queue until it is full because of a lack of 
resources. You can reserve a minimum number of packets per queue. 
This minimum is set to 100 packets per queue by default. You can 
modify this min reserve value for each queue if you define 
different min reserve values and assign one of the values to each queue.

A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010738/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Catalyst&#32;3550&#32;Tutorial.pdf">Cat 3550 tutorial</a> says
that the answer is that total shared memory is 2 Mbytes in agreement
with the datasheet. The funny thing is that 3550 lists buffer capacity
in terms of <i>packets</i> instead of <i>Bytes.</i> Nowhere does Cisco
claim that the 3550 has a particle memory architecture. I suspect
that buffer memory is off-chip and there is a lot of it. All buffers
are sized for a max length packet - 1500 bytes.   Memory
for the Gig-E ports may not be shared and therefore outside the 2 MB
of shared memory used by the access ports.

Cisco has an entire book: <i>Cisco Catalyst QoS: Quality of
Service in Campus Networks</i> [2003]. It contains an entire
chapter on the Cat3550 and there is nothing that helps make
this any clearer. Perhaps in 2017 it is not that important.
