<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
<ul>On August 7th, 2020, APS Networks® was founded by Alexander Jeffries,
Andrew Heal &amp; Joerg Peter Hahn, and started trading from October 2020.
APS Networks® acquired the Advanced Programmable Switches (APS®) BF2556X-1T
and BF6064X-T from its current product portfolio, including IP, staff and
related customer base from STORDIS as part of an asset deal, forming an
ideal starting ground for the company. The two  APS® switches were originally
launched at the 2019 OCP Global Summit in San Diego, CA, US. APS Networks®
now provides support to all global customers who have acquired or a planning
to acquire the APS® switches.
