    Let me preface this post by saying that I am absolutely not an enterprise IT or systems guy, take everything that I write here on out with that as a side dish. I&#8217;m also very, very cheap.
That said, one of the things I really like about KVM is the ability to easily view the console of a guest system using free, non-windows software like VNC. However, much like everything in life, there are reasons to do one thing or another.

    Jon Langemak has a great write up on building the OpenDaylight controller under CentOS. Since I&#8217;ll have to do this a bunch of times, I though tI&#8217;d take what he so generously put online and build a very rudimentary script for deploying ODC under CentOS. The prerequisites are that you already have an account and ssh key at the OpenDaylight GIT repo and that you disable SELinux. Here is the script: #!

    There has been some recent chatter on the IPv6 Ops mailing list about the feature matrix. Sadly, I&#8217;ve let this sort of wither on the vine for a while in favor of OpenFlow and SDN. At the end of the day, though, as a whole we actually need IPv6 more than SDN and OpenFlow at this moment in time, so I&#8217;m resurrecting it. It is available here.
A few additions have been made and there is now a &#8220;last edited&#8221; cell so folks can tell if the data is stale or not.

    I love to be the &#8220;uncola&#8221; of networking sites. I like interop and I don&#8217;t do a lot with Cisco because I don&#8217;t have access to much of their gear anymore. So, that being the case, I had a need to bring up a l2circuit (in JunOS speak), or VLL (in Brocade speak) between an MX480 and an MLX. Since they are very different platforms, I had to do some digging and playing around to get it to work.

    I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of MPLS in the last 45 or so days (which is one of the reasons I have been absentee in the OpenFlow world lately). Having had almost no real world MPLS experience aside from a handful of pseudo-wires and a very small LDP signaled network, I had to spend some time reading, hacking at routers and essentially learning. In doing so, I found a few things.

    I recently had the need to debug a run away ip_rx process on an older Brocade MLX. For anyone that has had to do any type of low level debugging on the Brocade (Foundry) platform, you know that there many somewhat deep level diagnostics that are possible. The debug (like cisco debug) is a bit lacking, but the dm, LP and MP commands are very useful (and a tad scary).

    One of my biggest complaints about VMware is that it is an enterprise application. It has historically catered to the masses, which I completely understand, but those of us that aren&#8217;t a fortune 500 company are figuratively and operationally shoved into a corner and forced to find hackish ways of doing things to work around the enterprise nature.
One really, really good example of this is OS dependency. I hated architecture dependencies back in the old days (x86, SPARC, PPC) and I absolutely despise things that are OS platform dependent now.

    I want to preface this by saying that I have not seen or worked on the cumulus networks system yet. This is a stream of consciousness post on my thoughts and opinions based on what I&#8217;ve read publicly.
Recently a new network player has emerged on the scene with a very simple, straightforward idea. Take linux and put it on a switch. While this isn&#8217;t exactly new (see Juniper and FreeBSD, Arista with Linux, Force10 with NetBSD or the plethora of other vendors using an opensource OS as the underpinnings of their NOS), the angle that cumulus networks is taking is a bit more&#8230;.

    I had the need to build a FlowVisor instance under CentOS. Since nearly all of the docs I could find were for debian, I threw this together. I utilized this GENI doc and the github docs as a simple reference. This is the quick and dirty method I used:
