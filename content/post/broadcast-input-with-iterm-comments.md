I leave a response when I like a article on a site or I have something to add to the discussion. It's caused by the fire displayed in the post I browsed. And on this article Broadcast input with iTerm2. I was actually excited enough to drop a commenta response :) I actually do have a couple of questions for you if you don't mind. Is it only me or does it appear like a few of the remarks come across as if they are coming from brain dead visitors? :-P And, if you are writing at additional social sites, I would like to keep up with everything fresh you have to post. Would you list all of your public pages like your linkedin profile, Facebook page or twitter feed?
