The 6807xl chassis is joined at the hip with the Supervisor 6T that was introduced at the same time.
The supervisor has its own listing in its place amoung the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010617/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/catalyst6500"> supervisor heros.</a>
The chassis also supports many line cards from the previous supervisor hit list -- as long as they are
not too old. All is listed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010617/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/6807xl-datasheet.pdf">data sheet.</a>

The Catalyst and its family are difficult to fit into this web page's table format and Cisco

Some historical perspective can be gleaned from this marketing slide [circa 2018]:
