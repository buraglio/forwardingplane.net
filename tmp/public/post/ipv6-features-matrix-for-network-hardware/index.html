    <h1 class="title"> IPv6 Features matrix for Network Hardware </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of IPv6 stuff lately, and one of the things I didn&rsquo;t find (and kinda just wanted to put one together for my own benefit) is a matrix of features I thought were important to have on the IPv6 side for common network hardware. Below is a work in progress of what I have so far, which will automatically publish changes from <a href="http://bit.ly/network-hardware-v6-feature-matrix">this spreadsheet</a>. Please email me if you&rsquo;re interested in adding to this or correcting anything I may be incorrect on.</p>

<p>This has evolved into something else entirely. I&rsquo;ve had a very good response to this very rudimentary start of a feature matrix and have decided that it&rsquo;s going to get expanded into whatever it needs to become. I&rsquo;ve added the start of a matrix for network security hardware / appliances <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/bit.ly/ipv6-security-matrix">here</a>.<br />
I may eventually break this out into L2 and L3 as well as security appliances.</p>
