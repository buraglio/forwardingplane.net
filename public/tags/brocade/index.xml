Thank you for a very good and honest review. We all need more feedback like this. REALLY Not happy about your sshd results. Will look into asap. Thanks for taking the time to do all the work that went into this!!!! Jon Nick Buraglio - Dec 0, 2012
Thanks, Jon. I do have high hopes for this product. It is innovative and yet accessible. Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us.</description>

      <description>I recently had the opportinity to work with the much-anticipated Brocade VDX &amp;ldquo;Ethernet Fabric&amp;rdquo; platform. I do admit tha tI&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by this product. I&amp;rsquo;d seen it work multiple times in demos and it worked so well and looked to easy that we actively tried to throw curve balls at the demo organizer to prove it wasn&amp;rsquo;t canned. It succeeded. The hardware hashing across the VLAGs is very slick. The VMware VSwitch integration worked well and was handy.</description>
