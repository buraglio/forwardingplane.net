<p>“Multihoming IPv6 is a pathway to many things some consider to be ……unnatural.” ―Darth Sidious, maybe. The current state of usability for multihoming IPv6 is fairly limited, and not terribly supportable. That said, it <em><strong>is</strong></em> doable, if you have the fortitude and hardware / software to make it happen. </p>

<p>In this episode of <a href="https://modem.show">MODEM</a>, we get super nerdy about the current state of multihoming IPv6 and all of the gory details and exposed limitations. Join Chris Cummings, myself, and John Osmond as we discuss a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fbnvv-v6ops-site-multihoming/">new IETF draft</a> that describes the current state of multihoming in the IPv6 world. And no, we aren’t just talking about BGP. </p>
