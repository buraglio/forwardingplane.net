The 3548 is a strange bird.At introduction this switch does not support IPv6. 
This is Cisco custom switch on a chip silicon. 
It has 3 pools of buffers that support 16 ports each. So 1/3 of the total RAM (5 MB) is available to an output port.

Cisco has a nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010747/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/nexus-3548-architecture.pdf">architecture review</a> that
includes this figure and explains what they are doing.  The Nexus 3548 includes the
ability to do fine grained reporting on packet buffer utilization. The reports are
similar to Arista LANZ.

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010747/http://lippisreport.com/">Lippis Report</a>
published a commissioned review <i>Cisco Nexus 3548 Top-of-Rack Switch
Performance and Power Test</i> with a cover date of July, 2013.  
Registration is required to get a copy of the report. 
Like many Lippis reviews they conclude:
<p>
<i>The Cisco Nexus 3548 represents a
new breed of data center ToR switches. . .</i>
<p>
They use those words a lot. Lippis does not cover microburst capability or packet buffering.
These are covered in the architecture paper.

A deep dive on buffer monitoring was presented at CiscoLive! in July 2016.
Here, in each one-second interval buffer occupancy was measured 250 
times and the count of hits on each bucket are reported.  In this example, 
a slug of traffic loads the buffers which then drain over several seconds.
Note bene, the oldest reports are at the bottom and time increases toward 
the top of the display.

Ivan Pepeinjak commented on the Nexus 3548 in a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010747/http://blog.ipspace.net/2012/09/cisco-nexus-3548-victory-for-custom.html">blog post</a> 
comparing it directly with the Arista 7150S.
<p>
Cisco has rolled the silicon in the 3548 and produced a new model March 2015. Quoting:
<ul>
The Cisco Nexus 3548x and 3524x Switches (Figure 4) are the next generation of the Cisco Nexus 3500 platform. Like the previous generation, these switches are compact 1RU form-factor 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches and provide line-rate Layer 2 and 3 switching with ultra-low latency. In addition, they consume 25% less power. This new generation introduces powerful hardware-based multicast NAT and latency monitoring capabilities and a second USB port for easier manageability.
</ul>
The 3548 has reached End-of-Life, announced April 2016. 
Still no support for IPv6. The 3548X can combine four 10G ports into a single
40 Gb/s port using a reverse breakout cable.
