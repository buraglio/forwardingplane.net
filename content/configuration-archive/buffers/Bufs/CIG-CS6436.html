<h3>CIG CS-6436-56P</h3>
<p>
<table width="700">
<tr><td>
A member of the Nephos Taurus family. <b>CIG</b> stands for <i>Cambridge Industries Group</i>.
Perhaps noteworthy, the Taurus family is a <i>chiplet</i> design. The specs don't say this,
but I suspect that the SERDES are separate from the body of the switch ASIC and added in sufficient
number to provide the ports required for each family member. A full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/CS-6436.pdf">
design package</a> was submitted to OCP.
<p>
The OCP submission also included a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010601/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/CIG-CS6436-56PP.pdf">
slide show</a> that contains the size of the packet memory.
