I love some measurement data. On this IPv6 Buzz, Tom and I talk about measuring IPv6 and IPv6 statistics. We talk about why it’s useful to measure IPv6, how to track v6 deployment initiatives, and tools to help with your measurements. There is more there than one may think! In particular, we discuss my new project the [IPv6 Global Statistics Dashboard](https://stats.ipv6.army), which aims to agfgregate *all* IPv6 statistical data regarding deployment.
