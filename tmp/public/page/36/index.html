    It&#8217;s always annoying to me, being a convert from *BSD to Linux, that tools lke dig and host aren&#8217;t in the minimal base install. I realise that this makes me somewhat of a hypocrite, as I prefer an additive system rather than a subtractive base OS. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m continually surprised that &#8220;host&#8221; isn&#8217;t available after installing a minimal CentOS system without adding an additional package. So, since I always forget, here is a quick blog post to remind me and any other converts how to install those tools:

    I have a bunch of Apple wireless gear at my house. It&#8217;s inexpensive, feature rich and easy to maintain. However, with the update to mountain lion a while ago, the ability to install the older Airport Utility stopped. This is annoying since I have what apple now considers &#8220;advanced&#8221; features like IPv6 at my home and essentially all my gear here is a lab (except for the plex server =)

    I&#8217;ve been lamenting about the SDN WAN options for a while now. Having SDN/OpenFlow in a data center or campus is relatively well documented and already widely deployed. Google has been doing SDN across their private WAN in production. These pieces are easy. What isn&#8217;t easy is the ability to plumb SDN across many domains that are under disparate control. This part is hard. What is lacking is a fundamental framework, or set of primitives to build from.

    There has been a lot of buzz about the service provider model, net neutrality and tiered access for consumers in the past few years. Just this week Google has been accused of paying Orange (more likely Orange is forcing google) for handling its traffic. This is a VERY slippery slope that teeters on the edge of what we all want to avoid as consumers or content creators.
This recent story has sparked something I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a very long time.

    If you are running a network and aren&#8217;t using RANCID, you should give it a serious look. RANCID is a cross platform configuration management toolkit for backing up router configurations and certain environmental and hardware information into version control. It&#8217;s been around for as long as I can remember and supports nearly every platform I can think of, including a few modules that I cobbled together myself. There is are a few nice web based front ends for CVS and SVN, I prefer to use ViewVC because I have a lot of experience with it, however, there may be cases where a web server isn&#8217;t a good option, unavailable or just too much work.

    Starting from a base CentOS system with nothing configured, and referencing the CentOS wiki, here is how I like to set up a headless virtualbox environment:
Disable selinux. It&#8217;s overly cumbersome and is enabled by default in CentOS. I like to permanently disable it even though the default is permissive. I ride the edge, I know.
vi /etc/selinux/config  and change  SELINUX=enabled  to  SELINUX=disabled  Then reboot.  Using the methodology I originally found found here, I like to install the epel repo using this method:

    A bit of back history: I came from BSD land. I was a FreeBSD user from way back in the 1990s. BSD land is a land of secure boxes and very high uptimes. It&#8217;s also a land of arguably clunky package support, a lot of compiling by hand and these days, not nearly as encompassing package and network tuning support. I decided to move to Linux&rdquo;) a while ago, reluctantly, and chose Debian as my flavor of choice.

    Recently we encountered a very strange behavior on an SRX 5800 cluster. The cluster, which is in active/active mode, started dropping OSPF adjacencies to it&#8217;s neighboring routing equipment, in this case, Juniper MX480 and Brocade/Foundry MLX8. Strange behavior indeed, since for us, these had been rock solid for around 2 years and we&#8217;d never seen this odd behavior before.
Honestly, we started looking at the routers first since this was something the SRX has never done before.

    It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a fan of the model Arista Networks is using to make gear and provide innovative services and products. In my opinion, they&#8217;re changing the landscape of campus and data center networking gear. I&#8217;m always a fan of the little guy trying to change the world and this falls under that category. For those that don&#8217;t know, Arista Networks is a &#8220;hardware&#8221; networking company that is using merchant silicon wrapped in their custom linux based operating system (which is very much like IOS).

    Recently SI6 released the IPv6 Toolkit 1.3  This release is on the heels of this IETF draft  on IPv6 host scanning. It was long thought that scanning an IPv6 network was impossible. The address space was too large and reliably ascertaining the hosts from it would be too time consuming to even attempt. However, as Dr. Hans Zarkov says in the 1980 classic cult film of my youth, Flash Gordon, &#8220;You can&#8217;t beat the human spirit!
