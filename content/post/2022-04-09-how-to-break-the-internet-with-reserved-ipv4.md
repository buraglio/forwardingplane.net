The future called and it wants more IPv4 space. As much as I am a staunch proponent of IPv6, I get the need for more IPv4. Cloud providers, enterprises, ISPs, they all need it to stave off the CG-NAT as long as possible. Well, some friends came up with a pretty straightforward way to get it - or, according to some "completely break the internet". We recorded [this episode](https://anchor.fm/modulate-demodulate/episodes/Unicast-Use-of-the-Formerly-Reserved-address-blocks-with-Dave-Taht-and-Seth-Schoen-e1gnfam) with [Dave Taht](https://twitter.com/mtaht) (who you may remember from our [podcast on bufferbloat](http://modem.show/post/s01e07/)) and [Seth David Schoen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Schoen) about some new drafts they wrote for the [Unicast Use of the Formerly Reserved <sup>240</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-schoen-intarea-unicast-240-00.html), 127.0.0.0 (loopback space), the 0.0.0.0 block, and the 255.255.255 block, back in February. Needless to say, it was pretty interesting. Full of very polarizing topics (for oh-so-many reasons) this winding and wandering podcast lays out the history as well as the justifications for taking such address blocks - historically held as “untouchable” - and advocates for moving them into general use. Take a listen [here](https://anchor.fm/modulate-demodulate/episodes/Unicast-Use-of-the-Formerly-Reserved-address-blocks-with-Dave-Taht-and-Seth-Schoen-e1gnfam) and decide for yourself!
