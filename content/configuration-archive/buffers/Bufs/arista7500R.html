<h2>Arista 7500R switches</h2>

Introduced March 29, 2016. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010712/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7500R-press.pdf">Press release</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010712/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Arista7500R.pdf">architecture paper</a>

<p>
Networkworld thinks this as based on the Broadcom Jericho switch chip. They said:
<p>
<ul>
The products leverage the Broadcom Jericho chipset which is optimized for 100 Gig-E, deep buffers and routing.
</ul>
<p>
A January 2016 posting on NANOG said:
<p>
<ul>
The BCM88670 (Jericho) is what powers the new Cisco NCS55XX devices. The processor
is linerate above around 100 bytes per packet without external TCAM, supports 256K
IPv4/64K IPv6 FIB entries (or mixed amounts). These chips are being used for high
scale 100G, the initial NCS5508 linecard is a 36x100G QSFP28 one.
<p>
Juniper has chosen to use their own silicon for most of their dense 100G platforms,
but you will see these chips used by pretty much everyone else I imagine at some point i
n the next year.
</ul>
Arista has an extra cost software option called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010712/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/FlexRoute-WP.pdf"> FlexRoute</a> that works like hamburger
helper. It dilutes and extends the expensive TCAM [hamburger] to make it appear that
there is more than it first appeared. With <i>helper</i>, 256K worth of TCAM is
stretched to cover 1M routes, along with a promise that future recipes may cut
that even further.
<p>
Arista makes explicit buffer claims in the architecture paper cited above 
and repeated here. Arista's Martin Hull claims 50 mS of data can be stored
on each input port. There is probably some double counting here, but that
should be OK.
