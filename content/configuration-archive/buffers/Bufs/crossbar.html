Wikipedia's entry for <i>crossbar</i> is diluted with discussions of 
fusible link EPROMs and old telco mechanical switches. A better place
to go is Greg Ferro's blog. He gave a straight-forward
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010723/http://etherealmind.com/switch-fabrics-farbic-arbitration-and-buffers/">definition of a crossbar</a> in August 2011.  Greg has a follow-on blog
entry on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010723/http://etherealmind.com/switch-fabric-input-output-buffers-queues/">Buffers for a Switch Fabric</a> written in Sept 2011.
<p>
What should be the next blog entry in Ferro's series is details about
how crossbars can be equipped with fancy arbitors to facilitate 
switching even when the packet at the head of the line needs to be
buffered. For example, setting up queues per output port in each input
buffer and then permitting packets to cross the fabric when they
can find an open path can help with head-of-line blocking. So
can arbitors that can reach into the middle of a queue to search
for a packet that isn't blocked.
<p>
Rich Seifert's <i>The Switch Book</i> [2001] discusses these techniques.
Seifert produced a second edition <i>All-New Switch Book</i> in 2008 but
the material on crossbar switching has not been substantially changed.
