        I recently had a need to test OpenFlow on the brocade ICX 7450 for a fairly good sized, high visibility project. The basic goal is pretty simple, Layer2 path provisioning. Straightforward and fairly well supported in OpenFlow, even from the early days. To do this, the idea was to use a turnkey platform, that way there is one throat to choke if there are issues. I landed on the Brocade Vyatta controller (which is essentially ODL), and the ICX.

        Back in February of this year (2015) I was introduced to Solarwinds when they presented to us at Networking Field day 9. Until then I knew of SolarWinds products but only at a cursory level; I had never really seen or used their stuff since it was mostly focused on environments that were either smaller or outside of the networking world that I generally operate in. However, I am a[n insufferable] network monitoring &#8220;aficionado&#8221; so when the opportunity to play around with it arose, I happily took it.

        A few years ago I wrote some text on interdomain SDN. Years later, work is being done, smart people are thinking about it and building ways to make it a reality. Not being one to give up on an idea, I gave this presentation in may at ChiNOG on what my take on what that architecture should be. I (we) propose that the use of existing protocols such as BGP FlowSpec will make this realistically deployable and maintainable given some simple, pluggable middleware.

        I&#8217;m way overdue for a soapbox session &#8212; I found this one in my drafts and thought it was something I needed to put out there. It&#8217;s already dated in terminology but that actually helps make the point &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to keep up.    Lets throw this out there: social media can be exhausting. Do not misunderstand me, it’s a great tool for communication, obtaining and disseminating information as well as standard goofing around.

        The sixth [and arguably very overdue] installment of my NIX4NetEng series, this began as an overly complex diatribe about DNS. As it evolved, I realized that DNS is so complex and far reaching that it could never be contained in one meager post. DNS is a powerful tool. It has existed for so long that many that have never had the responsibility of running an authoritative or recursive resolver may take for granted the extensive reach of a tool so engrained in the fabric of the internet that it is frequently overlooked, much like a utility such as electricity or running water.

        I was recently at a meeting where BGP RPKI was the topic de jour. While this has been a topic that I have visited on occasion of the last few years and something I wanted to spend significant time on, I have found that setting aside the time has been difficult and sparse, much like the deployment of BGP RPKI. In order to better understand the options available, it&#8217;s important to break down the pieces and terminology involved; BGP is daunting enough to those unfamiliar with it and adding PKI on top of that can be even more so.

        Edit: Going against my normal “just get the content out there” methodology, I’ve been mulling over this blog post since July of 2016. Segment routing is such a beautifully elegant solution I have had trouble articulating that fact. WAN technologies are squarely within my wheelhouse, and this one fits in so well I was going over and over the post never really satisfied with it, continuing to find mistakes and decided to just get it out there.

        In the last few years I have moved all of my virtualization to proxmox and docker. Seeing as I like to look at packets because I am a closet security guy, and being as I have been working off-and-on on a security project in recent times, I wanted to be able to span a port not only from a hardware switch, but also within my software switches. I had been using linux bridge, which I am not a fan of, so when I started down this path I did not look hard to find a way to do so under that platform.

        Taking politics and putting them aside, what the new administration has been attempting to change with regard to internet privacy is something we should all be informed about. Wether you have a tin foil hat or don&#8217;t care, &#8220;knowing is half the battle&#8221;. The other half is doing &#8211; which I will also lend some brief insight to (sorta).
What&#8217;s changing? Nothing yet (as of the time of this writing). What will likely change?

        Anyone that looks at this site with any regularity may have noticed that I have been pretty remiss in adding posts &#8211; for that I apologize, things have been busy. However, I have not been absent in the tech world&#8230;quite the opposite, in fact. I&#8217;ve been spending more and more time on podcasts and other forms of tech media which I have not provided links for here. So, to help expose that, here are a few of the other media resources I&#8217;ve been popping up in.
