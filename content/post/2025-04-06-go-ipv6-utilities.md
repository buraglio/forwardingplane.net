After spending some time with Python, I moved to Go, which seems to suit the way my brain works slightly better (make no mistake, I am still a poor developer). Keeping in line with the work done on [this](https://github.com/buraglio/ipv6-subnet-planner), I endeavored to re-write this in Golang, mostly because the subnet generation in python had some resource issues with large blocks. 

And off I went. With the help of an LLM to get me past weird errors and inability to compile, the resulting code is surprisingly efficient and useful - available [here](https://github.com/buraglio/ipv6utils)

### IPv6 Subnet Generator & RFC 6052 Converter  

#### Current capabilities:

A command-line utility for IPv6 subnet generation and IPv4/IPv6 address translation using RFC 6052.
The pre-compiled binary is compiled for Apple silicon, but since it's go it can be run on pretty much anything with minimal resource footprint.

## Features
- **IPv6 Subnet Generation**  
  - Generate subnets from an IPv6 prefix.  
  - Optionally limit output using `-l` flag.
- **IPv4 â†” RFC 6052 IPv6 Conversion**  
  - Convert IPv4 to a synthesized IPv6 address (`-s IPv4`).  
  - Convert an RFC 6052 IPv6 address back to IPv4.  
- **Custom Prefix Support** (`-k`)  
  - Allows non-well-known prefixes.
- **Decode MAC address from SLAAC address** (-m)
  - Decode MAC addresses from non-privacy SLAAC addresses
- **Decode link local addresses** (-a)
  - Decode link local address to MAC, and MAC to link local

Because why not, I also forked this and made a webified version that is available with essentially the same functionality [here](https://tools.forwardingplane.net).
