<h2>Telco Systems T-Metro-8100</h2>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/T-metro-8100.JPG" alt="1 RU switch 2 100 G uplinks">
<p>
Introduced 19 May 2016
<p>
The big market for switches is in the data center. Telco Systems is not in that market. 
That makes me curious. A standard feature of these switches is an MPLS feature set
useful for WAN edge aggregation. The <i>speeds and feeds</i> of this critter with
two fast uplinks and 48 10 Gb/s workers is one of the things that sets this apart
from data center offerings. Telco Systems also has OpenFlow 1.3 features.
<p>
Other than that, there is lots we don't know. We don't know whose silicon this is, or
what the buffer sizes are. What we have so far is just a lame 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/T-Metro-8100.pdf">data sheet</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/T-metro-8100F.html">
feature list</a>.. Telco Systems has their
own switch language called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ViNOX.pdf"> ViNOX</a>

There is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/T-Metro-8100_A4.pdf">updated data sheet</a>. Note that
the SFP+ ports can operate at either 1 or 10 Gb/s. Tomahawk chips can't do this.
