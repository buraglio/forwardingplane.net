I recently had the displeasure of dealing with a series of failed disks in my newly created ZFS based NAS.  I had cobbled together roughly 12TB of disk space and jammed them into an old PC, stretching the limits of the platform when I decided to go with ZFS.  I broke all of the rules, underpowered, single core PC, only a handful of GIG of non-ECC RAM, etc.  I'm sure storage guys are having a coronary after reading that, but it works for me and has minimal issues since I just relatively redundant need bulk storage and it doesn't need to be fast (the ethernet connection is only 100M). Machine stats are as such: AMD Sempron(tm) Processor 2800+ 2G NON-ECC memory The following disks:

The NAS was a long standing device on my network.  I've been using [NAS4FREE](http://www.nas4free.org/) for quite some time with fantastic results.  The disks are simply desktop drives, nothing fancy.  When I rebuilt it all using ZFS I found that I had not done 2 things.  I had not documented the warranty status of the devices and I had not enabled SMART monitoring.  I know, amateur hour at its finest; I'm OK with it, it's just for home use and I have offsite storage for anything super important. \*_As an aside, if you're looking to build a NAS I would both recommend [NAS4FREE](http://www.nas4free.org/) as well as doing something as simple as documenting the warranty information of each disk in the description field._ So, when I enabled SMART monitoring and email reporting. I found that several of my disks were failing their end-to-end tests when this started showing up in my inbox:  ```
The following warning/error was logged by the smartd daemon:
Device: /dev/ada1, Failed SMART usage Attribute: 184 End-to-End\_Error.
Device info:

ST2000DM001-1CH164, S/N:xxxxxxxx, WWN:5-000c50-08147e2a4, FW:CC26, 2.00 TB
```  Bad news. However, with ZFS it is supposed to be fantastically easy to do disk replacements.  I had chosen RAIDZ1 for both volumes, so they could each supposedly sustain a single disk failure. There are a lot of online references for zfs. I used [this page](http://panoramicsolution.com/blog/?p=353) as a starting point for replacing my disk. I dropped to the shell on the NAS and did the following to identify the right disk to remove:```

```ada8 needs replaced.  The volume it exists in is zfs0.  The formula used is _"zpool <command> <pool> <device>"_```
zpool offline zfs0 ada8
```None of my stuff is hot swap, so I have to shut down the box.```
shutdown -h now
```Yank out the old disk and install the new one.```
zpool replace zfs0 ada8

zpool online zfs0 ada8
```After that you'll see the disk getting resilvered, which will take a while.```
nas:~# zpool status zfs0
pool: zfs0

status: One or more devices is currently being resilvered. The pool will
continue to function, possibly in a degraded state.
action: Wait for the resilver to complete.
