    <h1 class="title"> Replace ZFS RAIDZ1 disk </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I recently had the displeasure of dealing with a series of failed disks in my newly created ZFS based NAS.  I had cobbled together roughly 12TB of disk space and jammed them into an old PC, stretching the limits of the platform when I decided to go with ZFS.  I broke all of the rules, underpowered, single core PC, only a handful of GIG of non-ECC RAM, etc.  I&rsquo;m sure storage guys are having a coronary after reading that, but it works for me and has minimal issues since I just relatively redundant need bulk storage and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be fast (the ethernet connection is only 100M). Machine stats are as such: AMD Sempron&trade; Processor 2800+ 2G NON-ECC memory The following disks:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-10-13.49.35.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-10-13.49.35-1024x280.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-03-10 13.49.35" /></a></p>

<p>The NAS was a long standing device on my network.  I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://www.nas4free.org/">NAS4FREE</a> for quite some time with fantastic results.  The disks are simply desktop drives, nothing fancy.  When I rebuilt it all using ZFS I found that I had not done 2 things.  I had not documented the warranty status of the devices and I had not enabled SMART monitoring.  I know, amateur hour at its finest; I&rsquo;m OK with it, it&rsquo;s just for home use and I have offsite storage for anything super important. *<em>As an aside, if you&rsquo;re looking to build a NAS I would both recommend <a href="http://www.nas4free.org/">NAS4FREE</a> as well as doing something as simple as documenting the warranty information of each disk in the description field.</em> So, when I enabled SMART monitoring and email reporting. I found that several of my disks were failing their end-to-end tests when this started showing up in my inbox:  ```
The following warning/error was logged by the smartd daemon:
Device: /dev/ada1, Failed SMART usage Attribute: 184 End-to-End_Error.
Device info:</p>

<pre><code>ST2000DM001-1CH164, S/N:xxxxxxxx, WWN:5-000c50-08147e2a4, FW:CC26, 2.00 TB
```  Bad news. However, with ZFS it is supposed to be fantastically easy to do disk replacements.  I had chosen RAIDZ1 for both volumes, so they could each supposedly sustain a single disk failure. There are a lot of online references for zfs. I used [this page](http://panoramicsolution.com/blog/?p=353) as a starting point for replacing my disk. I dropped to the shell on the NAS and did the following to identify the right disk to remove:```
