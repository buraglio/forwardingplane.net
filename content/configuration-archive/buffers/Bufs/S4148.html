<p>
<b>Introduced May 2017</b>
<p>
Actually a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010625/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/dell-S4100.pdf"> 
family of four</a> (or five) switches with either 28 or 48 access ports and either SFP+ or Tw-pair.
There is a fifth varient that includes fiber channel and 48 SFP+ access ports. Cumulusnetworks says in 
their hardware compatibility matrix that this is a <b>Broadcom Maverick</b>.
<p>
These switches are the topic of an Oct 2017 Tolly report at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010625/http://tolly.com/DocDetail.aspx?DocNumber=217126">
http://tolly.com/DocDetail.aspx?DocNumber=217126</a> that contains
some useful information. Quoting the relevant parts:
<ul>
<b>Port Buffering</b>
<p>
The Dell EMC switches use a common packet buffer that is 
shared across all ports of a given switch on a dynamic basis.
These buffers can be used to prevent packet loss by buffering
packets where an output port is momentarily oversubscribed.
Tolly engineers determined that the port buffer capacity of 
each of the switches was eight MB.
<p>
<i>and at the end of the report</i>
<p>
<b> Port Buffering</b>
<p>
To saturate the switch port buffers, engineers configured Ixia to provide
one line-rate traffic stream destined for a single port. Engineers 
created a separatge traffic burst destined to this fully-loaded port, and
verified that after traffic was stopped, that all packets were received.
</ul>
Maverick has 12 MB of packet memory and 8 MB is available to absorb a single
microburst. That tells us that Maverick is a single core design. Contrast
with Tomahawk's four core design.
<p>
<b>12 port family members</b>
<p>
In <b>January 2019</b> Dell added two S4112 12-port switches to the product line. The family data sheet has been revised to cover the new entries.
