Sold by fs.com. Think <i>fiber supply</i>. It appears that fs.com is a
distributor and not and OEM or ODM. So this switch is made by someone else.  There is a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/n8500-48b6c-25ge-and-100ge-ethernet-switch-datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a> but
if you zoom in on the center of the top of the switch photo it says <b>Redstone D2060</b>. 
So, when it was time to produce the data sheet in October 2017 no suitable picture was
available. An older switch was tapped to stand in for the beauty shot. There is
also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/N8500-catalog-page.pdf">catalog page</a> which gives the
web price. <i>n.b.</i> Check the vendor's web page and do not rely on
this snapshot for current price. This appears to be an Agema (Delta) AG5648v1.
