As noted in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010753/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/210616_APS6120Q.pdf">data sheet</a> this is
<i>preliminary</i>. It is interesting because it includes an intel FPGA along with
Gigabytes of HBM memory which might be in the data path. This could be interesting.
