The Edgecore AS7512-54X switch is a Top-of-Rack (TOR) or
spine switch for high-performance data centers.

In a compact 1 RU form factor, the switch provides line-rate L2

100GbE QSFP28, supporting up to 48 x 10/25 GbE, 6 x 40/100
GbE connections.

The AS7512-54XS can be deployed as a TOR switch support-
ing 10/25 GbE to servers with 40/100 GbE uplinks, or as a
spine switch supporting 40/100 GbE spine interconnects.

The AS7512-54X is a bare-metal switch loaded with the Open
