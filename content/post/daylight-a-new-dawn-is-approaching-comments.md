One frequent perceived technical problem with FeedBurner is the reduced number of subscribers being reported for the blogs using the service. This is not actually a technical problem with FeedBurner, but by the feed readers and aggregators that report to FeedBurner, as FeedBurner collects and tallies from those partners. Usually this problem is connected with one specific RSS reader or client. -^ Make sure you visit our own website as well <http://caramoan.co

Nick: Thanks for taking the time to write about OpenDaylight. One thing I did want to clarify is that onePK is not part of the Project or part of our contribution. The code we did contribute was the Service Abstraction Layer and App Framework from our ONE Controller, but those pieces are not built with or rely on onePK. Regards, Omar (@omarsultan) Cisco

Thanks, Omar! Great point, I was a tad off in my understanding and articulation of that. Thanks for the clarification, I see great potential in this project.
