Anounced September 2015
<p>
<i>Rewrite and update April 2018:</i> This is a Tomahawk with 128 SerDes
running at 20 Gb/s. 64 ports not withstanding, this is not a Tomahawk2.

The 7260QX-64 is
covered in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010642/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7060X_7260X_DS.pdf">combined data sheet</a>.
A surprise is that this the only QSFP switch that <b>cannot</b>
use a splitter to farm ports out to 4 x 10 Gb/s. It appears the SerDes
are locked at 20 Gb/s so that a pair of lanes has the right speed to make
a 40 Gb/s port along with an undisclosed gearbox.

An article September 14, 2015 in nextplatform.com Timothy Morgan said:
<ul>
There is a variant of this box called the 7260QX-64 that uses the Tomahawk ASIC but only supports 40 Gb/sec speeds (using QSFP+ ports), only 5.12 Gb/sec of switching bandwidth, and only 16 GB of buffer capacity. The aim of this machine is to be a lower cost spine switch for 40 Gb/sec networks that also burns less power than the older 40 Gb/sec switches based on 10 Gb/sec lanes and the Trident-II chips. This switch will cost around $1,000 per 40 Gb/sec port, says Hull, at list price. Port-to-port latency is at 550 nanoseconds. The 7260QX-64 will be available in the fourth quarter.
</ul>
He said <i>16 GB</i> but he meant <i>16 MB</i>. The <i>variant</i> to 
which Tim is referring references the 7260CX-64 which Tim says 
contains 4 Tomahawks. I think he has not accounted for the ASIC interconnect
fabric.
