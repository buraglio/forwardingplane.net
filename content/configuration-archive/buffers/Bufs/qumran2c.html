Broadcom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010618/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Jericho2-PR.pdf">announced Qumran-2C</a> in a
press release in Feb 2019. <i>Availability</i> is not included in the PR.
Delta/Agema has started work on switches that will use
it to make deep buffer leaf and spine switches with Deutsche Telekom as the
anchor customer. The Qumram-2C is related to Jericho-2C the same way that
Qumram is related to Jericho. The Qumram parts have dispensed with the
fabric interface and are thus suitable for single-chip switches only.
What they can get out of a single chip is represented by the Agema
switches listed under this heading.
