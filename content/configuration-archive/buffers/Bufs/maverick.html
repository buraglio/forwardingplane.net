<p>
This is part of a diagram from Alpha Networks OpenCompute Project submission.
<p>
In a presentation to an OpenCompute working group on February 13, 2017 
Alpha Networks said that the SNX-61A0-486T has been submitted to
OpenCompute.org.  This switch is based on a Broadcom part 
code named <i>Maverick</i> The part number is BCM56768. Maverick is the 
name of a company acquired by Broadcom in 1999. There appears to 
be no relation between the the chip and the acquired company.
<p>
Note that Broadcom has no information about either <i>BCM56760</i>
or <i>Maverick</i>. There was not a press release for the part, and
a published data sheet cannot be found. It was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010640/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/EC.png">
mentioned</a> but not discussed in a slide deck from Edgecore.
One way to think about this is that it is a Trident 2+ with gear
box integrated into a single ASIC.  

 
That
this is a downscale part may explain why Broadcom never issued
a press release on the part. The Alpha OCP submission paper
from which much of this is drawn uses both part numbers (BCM56760
and BCM56768) without an explanation.
<p>
Comparing Maverick with Tomahawk, the former has 1280 MPPS while the
later with more aggregate port capacity has about 4000 MPPS. That
means Maverick can use a single lookup engine (switch core) for the
whole ASIC where Tomahawk needs four. This is consistent with Tolly's
finding that the peak burst rate is 8 MB which is more than half 
the total packet memory and matches the Trident2+.
