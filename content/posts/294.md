I am very happy and flattered that this site actually proves to be useful to folks. It was always my intention to use this as a platform to try to give back a bit, to help with any data I may have run across that was interesting, useful, or obscure.  I utilize sites like [etherialmind.com](http://www.etherialmind.com), [packetpushers.net](http://www.packetpushers.net), [evilrouters.net](http://www.evilrouters.net), [networkstatic.net](http://wwwmetworkstatic.net) and [ioshints](http://blog.ioshints.info) more than I can even measure.  I wanted to try to contribute as much as I could to pay it back.  So, seeing at it's a new year and all, I couldn't resist doing some data mining on the analytics of this site over the course of the last 12 months. I was once again surprised to see that a firewall post was clearly the most popular.  The [recent post on the Sonicwall](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/sonicwall-old-dog-learns-some-new-tricks/ "Sonicwall – Old dog learns [some] new tricks") was the clear, overwhelming winner having more than twice the views as it's closest rival. [![](http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg "rear_view_mirror")](http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg) It's interesting to see that, especially since most of what I do every day is routing and switching.  However, when this site was originally brought online back in 2008 (as tech.buraglio.com) to house my [very](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/updating-srx-idp-signatures/ "Updating SRX IDP signatures") [rough](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/08/juniper-srx-cluster/ "Juniper SRX Cluster") [notes](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/srx-ipv6-flow-based-processing/ "SRX IPv6 flow based processing") [on](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/multicast-through-juniper-srx-5800/ "Multicast through Juniper SRX 5800") [the](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/enabling-ipv6-on-juniper-srx-5800-cluster/ "Enabling IPv6 on Juniper SRX 5800 cluster") [Juniper](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/01/moving-junos-code-between-srx-cluster-nodes/ "Moving JunOS code between SRX cluster nodes") [SRX](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/02/upgrading-a-new-srx-3600/ "Upgrading a new SRX 3600") platform that I had the pleasure of being a very early adopter of, it was really obvious that folks wanted to see that data.  Those posts, although somewhat old, continue to be pretty popular. The [post on Plexxi](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/plexxi-could-be-wdm-for-the-rest-of-us/ "Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us.") and the [post on SDN across the WAN](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/ "SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look") are also pretty popular and both are subjects I will likely revisit as time permits. I'm working on many, many cool projects this year and I plan to write notes on every one of them.  Hopefully they'll be useful to someone.   Welcome to 2013.  Let's blow some minds, melt some faces and push some envelopes.
