The SFP+ model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5812-54X_ONIE_DS_R01_20160707.pdf">AS5812</a> was introduced on 7 July 2016. 
A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5812-54T&#32;ONIE&#32;DS&#32;R01&#32;20160411.pdf">10G-baseT model</a>
was announced in April 2016. 
While the Trident2+ has the capability of hosting 100 Gb/s ports, Accton
has not done that here.  
More info on Trident2+ is in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/trident2.html"> ASIC page</a>. Uses BCM56864 with Intel Rangeley C2538 x86 CPU.

This switch is the successor to the AS5712-54X which uses the trident-II ASIC.
HPE rebrands and sells this as the Altoline 6921.
