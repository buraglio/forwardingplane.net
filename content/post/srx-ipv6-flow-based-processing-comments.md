We've found a at least one issue after this change. Apparently, our IKE ALG is no longer functioning as it was before.  
I'm not terribly confident in the SRX ALG implementations, so I'll be poking at juniper a but about that as I get time. they've been very responsive to our questions and issues so ar, I expect that this will either be fixed ASAP or pointed out as a problem on our end.
