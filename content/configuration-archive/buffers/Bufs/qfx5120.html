There are other varients of this switch with different port configurations but a heart of Trident 3.
QFX5120-48Y and QFX5120-32C. There is a family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/qfx5120.pdf">data sheet</a>.
<p>
Lifting a paragraph from the data sheet to highlight buffer characteristics:
<p>
<b>Intelligent buffer management:</b> The QFX5120 features a total
of 32 MB of shared buffers. While 25% of the total buffer
space is dedicated, the rest is shared among all ports and is
user-configurable. The intelligent buffer mechanism in the
QFX5120 effectively absorbs traffic bursts while providing
deterministic performance, significantly increasing
performance over static allocation.
