Announced in September 2014, just before Tomahawk.
<p>
Founder Guy Hutchison talked about chip memory at
the time of introduction.
<p>
<ul>
 There's a huge amount of memory, but we.re not saying how 
much -- it.s equal or better than [any existing switch chip]. 
It's like buffer memory, a large SRAM for arbitrary table 
memory that can be carved up [as needed, and a] small T-CAM 
for arbitrary range matching.
</ul>

Now that products have started to flow, the memory size has been revealed: 24 MB.
