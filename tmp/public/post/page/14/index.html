        Configuration management is a critical part of successfully and efficiently run any network. From the early days of networking there have been options for doing configuration backup. Several projects have been around for literally decades, enabling the backup of a myriad of critical network devices and providing historical archives. Many of these projects and platforms require a reasonable amount of unix experience and perhaps some development skills. I’m going to give a quick synopsis of my three favorites, these a all very different in execution but provide the same types of services &#8211; configuration backup, diff, and archive (and not much else).

        I have my +100 hat of irreverence on today so it&#8217;s time for a soapbox post.
Having recently read a several posts and articles on what seems to be the never-ending cavalcade of assertions that &#8220;networking people will be out of jobs and you&#8217;d better learn to be a programmer&#8221; &#8211; or more succinctly put: the &#8220;dramatic changes in IT networking&#8221;. To this I respond simply:

        You have one, right? Even if your entire strategy is “collect some flow data”, there is absolutely NO reason not to have a netflow implementation, and frankly, it will save you time and money over time if you make the effort to do it. I love network data and analytics and I have waxed poetic about how important they are at every opportunity. There are a myriad of options for analytics and flow data.

        *For anyone wigged out about the eyeball pic, those are my eyes 7 days after Lasik.        In the tradition of my NIX4NetEng series I&#8217;m going to dive deep into the world of strategy, and specifically into the strategy of how we look at and operate our networks, the data they generate and the analytics that are available (and often overlooked) in how networks are managed both long term and day-to-day.

        Build vs. buy is an often lamented and always hotly debated question in all aspects of IT, however, if one is able to truly look at all angles the answer is typically straightforward and can be rooted in one simple strategy: don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel.
Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel  Too many times we as an industry don&#8217;t do our homework &#8211; we are all guilty of it &#8211; and we reinvent a wheel.

        It&#8217;s no secret that RF technologies and what like to call &#8220;specialty networking&#8221; are two of my favorite things in the networking space. Put them together and it is like chocolate and peanut butter! Now, some may not consider Field Area Networking (FAN) to be &#8220;unconventional&#8221;, but it certainly falls well outside of the space of what is typically traditional enterprise networking. That said, Cisco&#8217;s FAN briefing at Network Field Day 17 really got me excited and thinking about the alternatives for the IoT space.

        I’ve been very vocal about the misinterpretation of NAT for many, many years. Since it&#8217;s inception, NAT has been slowly perverted into what many now believe to be a security mechanism. While I do see a reasonable use of IP masquerading in a larger security strategy, this is not the original intent (or implementation) of NAT. What mosts network engineers call &#8220;NAT&#8221; is actually one to many network port address translation &#8211; or taking one public address and &#8220;hiding&#8221; a number of private (likely RFC1918) addresses &#8220;behind&#8221; it, using ports to translate traffic and keeping the state of those connections.

        As a follow up to my last post, I wanted to dive a little deeper into the world of address translation and to suss out some of the more compelling details.   As I&#8217;ve said on many occasions, it pains me to see NAT referenced as a security mechanism. That said, where PNAT can be beneficial is in an overall privacy strategy, however, even that is comparatively low value and given the current state of global IPv4 allocations, arguably a detriment to usability &#8211; we’ll get to that &#8211; before we do, it is important to understand what ’NAT” as we call it today actually is, and to do that we need to explain all of the types of address translation (yes, there are several).

        IPv6 has been a crusade of mine for well over a decade. Wether it is teaching IPv6 workshops, offering advice to new users, answering questions, or evangelizing it ad nauseam, it is an important topic to me. The ISP world holds a special place in my heart since a good deal of my early experience came from building or assisting regional ISPs. Recently I had a fun opportunity to talk about deploying IPv6 on The Brothers WISP podcast.

        Recently, the venerable Ivan Pepelnjak published a very insightful article about automation becoming such a popular topic that was spawned by an email from one of his readers. I found this article to be spot on, and wanted to add a bit of my own opinion into the automation pie, as I have been spending a lot of time on automation as it related to existing networks as well as into SDN based environments.
