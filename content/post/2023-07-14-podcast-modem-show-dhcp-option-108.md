<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last year there has been a slow hum, quietly building around the notion of building what has been called an "IPv6-mostly" network. What does this term mean? How do we do it? Why bother? Well, let me attempt to answer those questions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, what is IPv6-mostly? Thankfully, it is pretty much what it sounds like - a network segment (i.e. a LAN segment) that is mostly IPv6, and only legacy IPv4 where it has to be. This is better described to in the RFC that defines the "how", <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8925">RFC8925</a>: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I<em>t would be beneficial for IPv6 deployment if operators could implement IPv6-mostly (or IPv4-on-demand) segments where IPv6-only hosts coexist with legacy dual-stack devices. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In practice, this works with IPv4-only devices just as well as dual-stack devices. I like to think of it as a network allowing a system to "operate at its highest level of network stack evolution". Because I had a bit of a time finding examples of how this is implemented in practice (the KEA docs are fantastic, but also very, very deep and comprehensive - a bit much to weed through when looking for a working example.</p>

<p>This KEA configuration assumed that that dhcp is centralized and being relayed via a router relay / ip helper. As mentioned in this <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2022/11/21/deploying-ipv6-mostly-access-networks/">APNIC blog</a>, option 108 is still a work in progress. It's still got <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/291235541">some issues with certain clients</a>, and is completely absent in all versions os Microsoft windows. </p>
