    <h1 class="title"> Basic reference openflow controller VMs running in CentOS 6 for KVM. </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I had been working, off and on, on a how-to for building the <a href="http://www.opendaylight.org/">daylight openflow controller</a> under CentOS.  Most openflow docs and dev are done under ubuntu or debian, and while those are both fantastic alternatives, there are a huge number of folks that will want or need to use RHEL or CentOS. So, seeing as that is the case, having someone be mindful of that is important.  When I saw the <a href="http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/installing-opendaylight-on-centos/">write up</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/blinken_lichten">Jon Langemak</a>, I scrapped my attempt at a how-to since his was so much better. If you&rsquo;re not following Jon and reading his blog, you should be.  He&rsquo;s a sharp guy with interesting things to say. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/projectfloodlight-logo-header.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/projectfloodlight-logo-header.png" alt="projectfloodlight-logo-header" /></a> That got me thinking about references and resources, and I decided that I would take a few of the things I had been working on on my home lab and make them available to the masses.  I&rsquo;m a fan of importable base VMs.  So, seeing that I am working on testing openflow controllers, it made sense in my [constantly racing] mind to make the reference, base level VMs available.  If anyone is interested in the <a href="http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/">floodlight controller</a> running under CentOS 6.3 built using the method documented <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/02/building-a-floodlight-openflow-controller-on-centos-6/" title="Building a Floodlight OpenFlow controller on CentOS 6">here</a>, a KVM image is now available to download from <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/vm-images/centos-floodlight-template.tbz">here</a>.  It is, as stated, a KVM image, created by using the method I documented in <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/centos-kvm-install-quick-start-to-a-vm/" title="CentOS KVM Install – Quick Start to a VM">this post</a> a few months ago.    There is a readme file in the archive wth basic instructions.  You&rsquo;ll need a basic understanding of <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> to make it work, or you can try to convert it to something else like vmware, XEN or virtualbox. I&rsquo;ll be adding one of these soon for <a href="http://www.opendaylight.org/">daylight</a> as well.</p>
