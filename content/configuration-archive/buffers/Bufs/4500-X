<h3>Advanced Quality of Service and Buffering</h3>
<p>
Advanced QoS with up to eight configurable queues per port and customizable queue size per queue
<p>
Active queue management through dynamic buffer limiting (DBL) to ensure bandwidth protection for low-rate critical and well-behaving flows such as voice traffic
<p>
32 mega bytes of centralized buffering optimized to handle bursty video traffic and server microbursts, helping make sure that business-critical packets are not lost because of insufficient buffering
</ul>
With control of the distribution of buffer memory across queues, it is possible
to allocate all the beans to a single queue, making the switch behave like a
on queue pony.
