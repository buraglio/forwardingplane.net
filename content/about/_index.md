This site is maintained by [Nick Buraglio](http://linkedin.com/in/buraglio/).  It is intended to be a journal and notebook for things I find useful, problems I'm working on or general technology rambling. [![Nick_Buraglio](https://www.ietf.org/lib/dt/media/photo/NB-BW_ea24tzu.jpg)](https://www.ietf.org/lib/dt/media/photo/NB-BW_ea24tzu.jpg) **It should be noted, however, that these pages are really just a personal notebook to me, stuff I find useful and things I may want to remember.  Please don't expect them to always be correct or complete .  I'm only human and I make mistakes just like anyone else.  This site may also contain my personal opinions  and do not, in any way, reflect my employer or anyone that may be paying me for consultation.  Or anyone but me.**

My resume / C.V. can be found [here](https://www.github.com/buraglio/resume/)

I have a lot of interests. I hold a bachelors degree in arts and technology (sequence in photography) with a minor in film studies and some of a minor in applied computer science from [Illinois State University](https://ilstu.edu/) and am currently a member of the Planning and Architecture team for the [Energy Sciences Network](https://www.es.net) (ESnet) and am a co-chair for the [IPv6 Operations working group in the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/v6ops/about/).  

In previous professional lives, I have been employed by the [University of Illinois](https://www.illinois.edu/) as a Lead Network Engineer, functioned as the Lead Network Engineer for the [National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA) broadband project of the year](http://uc2b.net/2012/09/13/uc2b-awarded-national-association-of-telecommunications-officers-and-advisors-natoa-2012-community-broadband-project-of-the-year/), [UC2B](http://uc2b.net/).  I have worked in the network provider industry in one way or another since the mid-1990s, holding Network Engineering positions at Regional Internet Providers as well as at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/). I've participated in [SCinet](https://scinet.supercomp.org/) on several occasions and was part of the Network Engineering working group that built and maintained the [TeraGrid](https://www.teragrid.org/). My professional resume can be found [here](https://github.com/buraglio/resume/).

I generally enjoy being creative and like to draw, do photography, and make jewelry as time permits. I love to watch movies and have frequently lamented that the best job I ever had was at a video store in the early 1990s. Sometimes I make [T-Shirt designs that are based on obscure movie or pop culture](https://www.teepublic.com/user/cinematic-omelete-studios), and sometimes I play an aging skateboarder in a punk rock band.

I occasionally hang out on several public and private Slack channels or on BlueSky - I am not terribly hard to find, but I am usually a bit slow to respond.
