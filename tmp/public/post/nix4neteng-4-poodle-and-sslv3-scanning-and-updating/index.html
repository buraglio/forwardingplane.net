    <div class="content"> <p>With the recent release of the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf">POODLE SSLv3 vulnerability</a>, folks are scrambling around trying to figure out what runs what and where.  Running a handful of things that do SSL, I was obligated, both personally and professionally, to figure out an easy way to drill down and figure out what does what and then fix the vulnerable services.  When there are a lot of devices, this can seem like a daunting task, and it is if you&rsquo;re trying to do it manually.  This is where <a href="http://nmap.org/">NMAP</a> comes into play.  NMAP is an extremely powerful tool for scanning and enumerating your own network, not just a tool for the script kiddies to port scan. Since there is no SSL patch at the time of this writing, and since SSLv3 is old and depricated, it is a good idea to see what services support it and then squish them in favor of TLS 1+.  Thankfully, smarter folks than myself have done most of the legwork for accomplishing this task and written most of it down <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html">here</a>. NMAP has a wealth of cool scripts and bolt ons that extend it in amazing ways.  To accomplish our tasks we&rsquo;ll ned to do a few things. Install nmap. I ran into issues with the <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse-library.html">nselibs</a> being incomplete, so I grabbed the source and built it that way as opposed to using yum.```
git clone git@github.com:nmap/nmap.git</p>

<p>From here we can see that there is a host that needs to be updated. There are a wealth of docs out there for changing out the supported version. Most of my stuff is apache so I used <a href="https://zmap.io/sslv3/">this guide</a>. For embedded devices, the best option is to filter access [which you should probably be doing anyway] until there is a patched firmware version.</p>
