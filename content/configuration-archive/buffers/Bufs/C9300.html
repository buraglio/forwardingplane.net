These switches are the successor to the Catalyst 3850. C3850s
use the UADP 1.0 and (later) 1.1 ASICs. The C9300s use the UADP 2.0
custom Cisco silicon. The entire family is stackable switches. The
bus that interconnects stack members runs at 480 Gb/s. But individual
stack members probably contain multiple ASICs or multi-core ASICs
that also use the stack system internally for core-to-core interconnect. The stacking architecture
permits packets to be recirculated through the switch processing
engine to implement things like VxLAN routing. In product videos
cisco hypes recirulation as a major enhancement that teaches old
ASICs new tricks. Other vendors have pipeline architectures with
multiple stages to achieve the same end. That may be a better idea.
Words about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010648/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cat3850">UADP 1.0</a> are relevant to
these products as well.
<p>
What Cisco has to
say about packet buffers is:
<p>
<table width="650" border="2">
<tr><td> Packet Buffer per SKU</td><td>16 MB buffer for 24- or 48-port Gigabit Ethernet models</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>32 MB buffer for 24-port Multigig models</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This was extracted from table 4 of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010648/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/datasheet-c78-738977.pdf">24-page data sheet.</a>  The information is less than
satisfying. Perhaps Cisco will publish a real architecture paper. If the multigig UX model
uses the same UADP ASIC as the gig-E models, then the per-core buffer would be the same.
So, it's a mystery. It does seem that the UADP 2.0 core engine has more packet memory than the 6 MB of the 1.1 predecessor.
<i>Buffer per SKU</i> is not what we want to know. We want <i>buffer per core</i>.
<p>
<h2>Uplink modules</h2>
<p>
The C9300 switches can use uplink modules from its C3850 predecessor. In addition, it
has it's own models which are not backward compatible to the C3850.

<h3>C9500-24Q <i>introduced</i> July 2017</h3>
<p>
<h3>C9500-40X <i>introduced</i> September 2017</h3>
<p>
The C9500-24Q and C9500-40X use the UADP2.0 XL ASIC. The C9300s use
the UADP 2.0 ASIC. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010648/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/uadp2.0family.png">differences</a>
are shown in the table. Both 2.0 ASICs have 28 nm features.
