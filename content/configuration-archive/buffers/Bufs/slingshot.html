<h2>HPE slingshot</h2>
<p>
HPE is selling what they call <b>HPC Ethernet</b>. This barely belongs
in my collection of switch hardware. Extensions to Ethernet to 
create <i>HPC Ethernet</i> do not appear to have been written
into a published standards document. The extensions to Ethernet
are entirely aimed at an interconnect to build large scale
array computers. As such, it would not be useful for campus or WAN
networking. Ports can be configured for either HPC Ethernet mode
or conventional Ethernet mode.  The new switch ASIC is named <b>rosetta</b>. 
<i>Slingshot</i> is the name of the switch that contains the
rosetta ASIC.  Best info about this is:
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010608/https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/08/16/how-cray-makes-ethernet-suited-for-hpc-and-ai-with-slingshot/">https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/08/16/how-cray-makes-ethernet-suited-for-hpc-and-ai-with-slingshot</a>
<p>
NextPlatform's guess is that Rosetta is a collaboration
with Broadcom riffing on the Tomahawk3. Some of the changes
to Ethernet are to allow for shorter minimum sized packets and
to provide for packet-by-packet routing through a mesh interconnect.
<p>
Slingshot is available in both air cooled and liquid cooled models. 
What there is <b>not</b> are model numbers for the switches.
HPE makes the point that packet buffering is the enemy of
low latency networking. This may be the reason that packet
buffer size has not been announced. Slingshot switches have
ways to guarantee packet delivery not based on buffering.
