<p>I recently had a need to test OpenFlow on the brocade ICX 7450 for a fairly good sized, high visibility <a href="http://scinet.supercomputing.org">project</a>. The basic goal is pretty simple, Layer2 path provisioning. Straightforward and fairly well supported in OpenFlow, even from the early days. To do this, the idea was to use a turnkey platform, that way there is one throat to choke if there are issues. I landed on the <a href="http://www1.brocade.com/forms/jsp/vyatta-controller/download.jsp">Brocade Vyatta controller</a> (which is essentially ODL), and the ICX. Below is a rough account of getting this up and working to the point of testing. For the purposes of this I used BVC 1.3 and an ICX 7450. The docs for the BVC are actually pretty good if you read them. I found the google searching for the docs led to <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> links to brocade being 404 errors. My guess is that they restructured their site and did not alias anything. Minor frustration since my guess is that most folks search using a search engine rather than going to the site and searching from there. The link to the configuration guide I used for the ICX is <a href="http://www.brocade.com/content/brocade/en/backend-content/pdf-page.html?/content/dam/common/documents/content-types/configuration-guide/fastiron-08030-sdnguide.pdf">here</a>. Once I grabbed the software, which requires registration, I went on to try to build this on CentOS 6.6. After some hurdles that I didn&rsquo;t expect, I went and actually read the doc for BVC and found that ubuntu is a requirement. Another minor annoyance, but surmountable pretty easily. Enterprise customers are probably not going to want to have a one-off from RHEL/CentOS even if I don&rsquo;t have a strong preference either way. Now that the VM is up and running with just over the minimum requirements, time to log in and get to work. This is assuming you have the code actually on the server already.```

<p>Monitoring the connection to the controller from the controller can be accomplished by using the included tool: /opt/bvc/bin/taillog which operates just like you think, by tailing a log file. Checking for capability can be pretty easily accomplished by looking at the restconf modules:```

<p>Thoughts: OpenFlow wants to use SSL by default. When configuring this it failed in a way that is not intuitive <em>at all</em>. To get it running quickly, you need to disable SSL, which I absolutely <em>do not</em> recommended for anything production). If you see anything other than this, the OpenFlow connection isn&rsquo;t working```

<p>To make this work over SSL requires pulling the certificates into the device from the controller. I am still working on this for consideration in a production environment. Path explorer has most of the interesting bits in it. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-4.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-4.png" alt="BVC-4" /></a> Other handy commands:```

<p>```The topology explorer is pretty cool, lots of eye candy. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-1.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-1.png" alt="BVC-1" /></a> Random Thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restarting the BVC causes the topology to need to rebuild, as one would expect. The ICX took longer to show up in the controller than I expected. In fact, it never recovered until I intervened manually.</li>
<li>The Brocade ICX randomly rebooted while attempting to scp the bootloader code. I never figured out why.</li>
<li>The ICX stopped responding to SSH for some reason. The only way I could recover it was to reboot. Concerning from a management standpoint, but I suspect it was an anomaly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next post I&rsquo;ll explore the actual provisioning and the SSL configuration.</p>
