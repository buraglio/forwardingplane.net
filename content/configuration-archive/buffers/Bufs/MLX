The diagram is taken from an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010633/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/MLX_Series_Architecture_WP.pdf">architecture</a> paper.
The buffers are on the line cards. Hence listings for each of several line cards. Brocade
provided me with a chart that details some of the policies that control the maximum size
of a single queue -- designed to keep one queue from taking all the cookies.

<p>
Internal to the interface cards, memory is organized in particles. Or
if you prefer, call them cells.  Particles
are chained together as required to make buffers as large or larger than the
packets they hold.
