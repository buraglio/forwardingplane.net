<h2>Arista 7010T</h2>
<p>
It appears that Arista introduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010740/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7010T-48_Datasheet.pdf">this switch</a> in August or Sept of 2014. 
There has been no splash in the trade press. 
Perhaps Arista is merely filling a hole in their high performance product line with a modest product that carries the Arista feature set and has good power consumption.
I placed this switch in the table next to an IBM offering with somewhat similar specifications, but proximity should not be considered to mean anything.
<p>
Thanks to ruairi carroll for bringing this to my attention.
