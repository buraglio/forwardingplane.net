    Build vs. buy is an often lamented and always hotly debated question in all aspects of IT, however, if one is able to truly look at all angles the answer is typically straightforward and can be rooted in one simple strategy: don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel.
Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel  Too many times we as an industry don&#8217;t do our homework &#8211; we are all guilty of it &#8211; and we reinvent a wheel.

    It&#8217;s no secret that RF technologies and what like to call &#8220;specialty networking&#8221; are two of my favorite things in the networking space. Put them together and it is like chocolate and peanut butter! Now, some may not consider Field Area Networking (FAN) to be &#8220;unconventional&#8221;, but it certainly falls well outside of the space of what is typically traditional enterprise networking. That said, Cisco&#8217;s FAN briefing at Network Field Day 17 really got me excited and thinking about the alternatives for the IoT space.

    I’ve been very vocal about the misinterpretation of NAT for many, many years. Since it&#8217;s inception, NAT has been slowly perverted into what many now believe to be a security mechanism. While I do see a reasonable use of IP masquerading in a larger security strategy, this is not the original intent (or implementation) of NAT. What mosts network engineers call &#8220;NAT&#8221; is actually one to many network port address translation &#8211; or taking one public address and &#8220;hiding&#8221; a number of private (likely RFC1918) addresses &#8220;behind&#8221; it, using ports to translate traffic and keeping the state of those connections.

    As a follow up to my last post, I wanted to dive a little deeper into the world of address translation and to suss out some of the more compelling details.   As I&#8217;ve said on many occasions, it pains me to see NAT referenced as a security mechanism. That said, where PNAT can be beneficial is in an overall privacy strategy, however, even that is comparatively low value and given the current state of global IPv4 allocations, arguably a detriment to usability &#8211; we’ll get to that &#8211; before we do, it is important to understand what ’NAT” as we call it today actually is, and to do that we need to explain all of the types of address translation (yes, there are several).

    IPv6 has been a crusade of mine for well over a decade. Wether it is teaching IPv6 workshops, offering advice to new users, answering questions, or evangelizing it ad nauseam, it is an important topic to me. The ISP world holds a special place in my heart since a good deal of my early experience came from building or assisting regional ISPs. Recently I had a fun opportunity to talk about deploying IPv6 on The Brothers WISP podcast.

    Recently, the venerable Ivan Pepelnjak published a very insightful article about automation becoming such a popular topic that was spawned by an email from one of his readers. I found this article to be spot on, and wanted to add a bit of my own opinion into the automation pie, as I have been spending a lot of time on automation as it related to existing networks as well as into SDN based environments.

    As an often-security-engineer and an individual that has been working on large networks for quite a while, dealing with DDoS, or the threat of DDoS is a well traveled path. Recently I was invited to discuss some of the basics of DDoS mitigation on the Network Collective Podcast. This was a really fun and insightful chat with a wealth of great information for engineers and operators of any skill level.

    Remember OpenFlow?

    In recent years, the nature of privacy on the internet has become a very important topic amongst those concerned with the now lack of net neutrality. The de-facto mechanism for dealing with privacy has been to &#8220;SSL all the things&#8220;, which I am very much in favor of. What many do not realize, though, is that simply using SSL for the traffic that transits a given ISP still leaves a wealth of thick, rich, delicious personal data still easily available to your ISP to harvest, sell, and do with as they please.

    A few months ago Kevin Myers of IP Architechs introduced me to a really interesting project called FreeRouter. Being that I absolutely love alternative routing platforms and feature complete simulation environments, this really got me going. I tend to define &#8220;feature complete&#8221; in a routing platform as something that can do both IS-IS and MPLS. Given that there aren&#8217;t many platforms that do both correctly or within a reasonable budget, and offer simulation options, I was pretty excited.
