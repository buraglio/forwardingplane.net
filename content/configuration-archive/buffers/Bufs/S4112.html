These switches are close cousins to the S4148 family, but they were introduced
later <b>January 2019</b>. The estimated date come from the <i>Series Installation Guide</i>.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010651/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/dell-emc-networking-S4100-series-spec-sheet.pdf">data sheet</a> says
that the ports on the <b>F</b> model can run at 25 or 10 Mb/s. Back pedalling to the 
48-port model, <i>some</i> of the ports can run that fast, but the Maverik lacks
the CPU horse-power to run them <i>all</i> that speedy.
