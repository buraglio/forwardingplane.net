Great post Nick. You are spot on. Without an incremental integration path it stays unicorns. Vendors are reluctant to own reference architectures so we will. Hey, its more fun that way anyways. The axis of state is being opened up which will need creative designs to leverage OF/SDN

I don't believe the hardware vendors ever had our interrests in mind. Or maybe they were never really good at translating what their users wanted. A lot of hardware vendors have never been very good at software. Software can have a model of user-driven development though. Especially if it is Free/Open Source Software. You want something to work in a way that suits you better ? You make a small change. Done. I think someone will solve these things with an overlay network in software.
