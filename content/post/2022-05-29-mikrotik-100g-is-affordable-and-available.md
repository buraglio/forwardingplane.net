<p>So, you need a 100G router or switch, but are deeply concerned about:&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ever-increasing need for faster interfaces, and standardization in the WAN at 10G and 100G rather than 40G or 25G as an interface spec has dramatically increased the need for 100G hardware. With power consumption of most 100G platforms rising to ludicrous levels, and the accompanying cooling required to keep those platforms running smoothly keeping pace with the power draw, one may start to believe there is little hope for 100G for the small to medium size networks. Couple that with supply chain issues and feature requirements, and all may seem fairly bleak. </p>

<p>Never fear, for we have news of the front, and that news is encouraging. Once again we have <a href="https://twitter.com/stubarea51">Kevin Myers</a> from <a href="https://iparchitechs.com/">IPArchitechs</a> (not anointed an official co-host, for whatever that means), who - <a href="https://twitter.com/mikrotik_com/status/1514257653354176523">even according to Mikrotik is "part of the family</a> - to tell us all the pieces, parts, details, and hidden gems about their new 100G platform, and we can confidently say, it's a doozey. So much greatness in here. We talk <a href="https://mikrotik.com/">Mikrotik</a> ROS7, 100G performance, unboxing (kevin had the first ones live in the US), future features, chipset capabilities, and as always, charming banter. Tune in and join Chris Cummings and Nick Buraglio along with Kevin, you won't be disappointed.Â </p>
