    As I sit here thinking if this site is worth my time, some words that someone said to me recently ring true. &#8220;Take from things you&#8217;re doing every day&#8221; is what <a href="http://www.twitter.com/networkstatic" target="_blank">Brent Salisbury</a> of [networkstatic.net](http://www.networkstatic.net/) said to me. He was right.  
    &#8230;And it was why I originally started this site, in a way. The original goal was to make a site I could take notes on and possibly help out someone trying to solve the same issues as me or look at something from the same perspective I had.  I do a lot of self study and tinkering in my home lab.  I also do a lot of off the wall things day to day.  I also do occasional consulting, when it&#8217;s interesting.  Taking notes on these things is probably useful to at least someone.  
    However, there is a lot of content out there saying a lot of the same stuff and in better, smarter and more digestible ways that I can. There are numerous Cisco focused sites that are far better than I could hope to produce in my nearly non-existent &#8220;free time&#8221;.  I know because I frequent many of them to help me.  <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/" target="_blank">IOSHints</a>, <a href="http://networkingnerd.net/" target="_blank">Networking Nerd</a>, <a href="http://packetlife.net/" target="_blank">Packet Life</a> are all fantastic resources.  Another of my favorite reads is <a href="http://www.evilrouters.net/" target="_blank">Evil Routers</a>.  It is sort of a unique bird, while the others are a tad cisco focused (not entirely, but mostly), <a href="https://twitter.com/jlgaddis" target="_blank">Jeremy Gaddis </a>throws in all kinds of amazing networking info in a well written manner and adds a significant amount of spice that is what I can only believe is his personality (I&#8217;ve never met him).  I can&#8217;t \*not\* read it.  I utilize these resource, in addition to <a href="http://www.networkstatic.net/" target="_blank">Network Static</a> and <a href="http://packetpushers.net/" target="_blank">Packet Pushers</a> almost daily.  I hope this can be a shadow of those sites.  If something from my never ending, incoherent rambling can help out one person in a tight bind or a day-to-day problem, then I&#8217;ll consider it a success.

    Back to the point.

   Enter this unkempt little corner of the internet.  Given that there is a bit of a lacking presence of non-cisco focused informational sites out there, maybe I can add some value&#8230;&#8230;or at least not detract.  Lets start with two things I&#8217;ve found useful.  One is something I&#8217;m always looking for and never seem to bookmark.  <a href="http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&#038;id=KB21476" target="_blank">JTAC Recommended Junos Software Versions</a>.  This is invaluable, and unless you&#8217;re doing something bleeding edge or edge case, this is a fantastic page to bookmark.  The other is a good resource for HP H3C networking gear.  <a href="https://twitter.com/jszc" target="_blank">Jeff</a> knows his stuff and likes to <a href="http://thenetworkmonkey.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">share it on his blog</a>.  He also knows a lot about other HP gear.
