    <h1 class="title"> Sonicwall revisited - Now with IPv6 - and way too much licensing cruft. </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>About a year ago <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/sonicwall-old-dog-learns-some-new-tricks/" title="Sonicwall – Old dog learns [some] new tricks">I did a brief review of the &ldquo;new Sonicwall&rdquo;</a>, specifically a smaller branch office device that was said should have had all of the features of the larger devices.  I proposed that it had some significant limitations (much to the disagreement of a great deal of folks).  However, I stand by my statements.  If you ignore the fact that firewalls often cause more problems than they solve, that NAT is a nightmarish kludge (and not a security mechanism), and <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/why-hardware-firewalls-are-the-walking-dead/" title="Why hardware firewalls are the walking dead">will likely be phased out for better options eventually</a>, the SonicOS I tested was pretty limited as far as what I believe should be features. Let&rsquo;s be clear, I&rsquo;m mostly talking about IPv6.  I&rsquo;ve ranted and raved that anyone not doing IPv6 is already years behind.  Get on the ball, you&rsquo;re already late to the game.  Yesterday, a colleague said something that resonated with me regarding this and it got me thinking about how much IPv6 support SonicOS had added.  Many folks that aren&rsquo;t doing IPv6 think that instead of doing something that may be a little hard that they&rsquo;re just not going to do anything.   They&rsquo;re dead wrong.  They&rsquo;re forcing themselves to do something else like CGN or multi-layer NAT, or something else equally (or more) unpleasant.  And then they&rsquo;ll do IPv6 anyway after that. It <strong>is</strong> inevitable. But I digress…. I pulled my old TZ-210 out and upgraded it to SonicOS Enhanced 5.9.0.2-107o.  What a pleasant surprise!  A <strong>huge</strong> amount of IPv6 support added!  <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sonicwall-v6-v4.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sonicwall-v6-v4.png" alt="sonicwall-v6-v4" /></a> They&rsquo;ve really done their homework here.  I was very surprised to see things like DHCPv6-PD with interface tracking.  Well done, Dell.  This will allow for small and home offices to take advantage of the Comcast and AT&amp;T DHCPv6-PD that they&rsquo;ve been offering for a while now, and lets be honest, once it&rsquo;s on, most folks will never even realize they&rsquo;re using IPv6. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sonicwall-dhcpv6.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sonicwall-dhcpv6-257x300.png" alt="sonicwall-dhcpv6" /></a> &lt;== This is a giant step forward for reasons that are far beyond simple protocol support.   <img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sonicwall-v6-fw-rules.png" alt="sonicwall-v6-fw-rules" />   I&rsquo;m very happy to see this level of support from Dell/Sonicwall.  I expected to put this box in, turn it on, use it for a few days and turn it off.  I set it up in transparent mode, tuned the rules a bit….and I have no real plans of taking it out.  I&rsquo;m actually pretty happy with it for the application I&rsquo;m using it for.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to really impede anything I want to do (after TCP ssh timeout rules to a reasonable time; BTW, timeouts are one of the reasons I don&rsquo;t like firewalls).     This brings me to my problem with Sonicwall (and many network and network security vendors).  My licenses have all expired. I can understand having to license services that cost money because they&rsquo;re licensed upstream services.  I get that, I really do.  However,  Some of the things that Dell requires licenses for seem a bit extreme to me.  The fact that I get essentially zero visualization options once the licenses expire is downright shameful.  No worries, I&rsquo;ll just export Netflow/IPFIX data.  Nope, also a licensed feature.  You heard that right.  No flow export, no real time monitor.  Heck, I can&rsquo;t even look at interface graphs on-box. I have to poll with a 3rd party tool suite.  Realistically, one gets significantly better instrumentation from a default <a href="http://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a> load.  And pfSense has had IPv6 support for years. If you take away all of the downright shameful licensing requirements to do anything useful with trending and instrumentation, this is a good platform. Their IPv6 support is solid now.   However, for anyone running  networks  that require instrumentation and visualization, you had better budget for [unnecessary] fees or have 3rd party mechanisms for collecting the data.</p>
