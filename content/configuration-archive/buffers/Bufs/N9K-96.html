<p>
<b>Introduced December 2016</b>
<p>
Broadcom Jericho is here. Two cards - C-R has QSFP28 ports while Q-R has 40 Gb/s QSFP ports.
The cards go into one of the 950x chassis, but require their own crossbar cards. After
some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010627/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cisco-n9k-lippisreport.pdf"> paid teeth knashing</a> 
from Nick Lippis in 2013 about how custom ASICs are better
than merchant silicon, well, here we are with a merchant based design.
<p>
The 100 Gb/s line card has six Jericho ASICs while the 40 G/s version has 3.
Like its Jericho brothers, queuing is on the input side of the switch fabric. This 
is a VoQ design.  Cisco has produced a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010627/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/white-paper-c11-738392.pdf">
