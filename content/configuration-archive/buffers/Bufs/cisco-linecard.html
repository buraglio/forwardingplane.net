<h2>Cisco Jericho2 line cards</h2>
<h3>NC57-24X400G-BA</h3>
<h3>NC57-18D12TH-SB</h3>
<table width="700">
<tr><td>
The NCS5500 family enhanced with 2nd generation fabric cards and fan trays can support Jericho2 line cards.
Cisco does not make a fixed configuration switch with the Jericho2. So line cards are us. Cisco has lots of
information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010554/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/datasheet-c78-742016.pdf">data sheet</a>. Each of these line cards has two
Jericho2 ASICs and cooks at about 900 Watts.
