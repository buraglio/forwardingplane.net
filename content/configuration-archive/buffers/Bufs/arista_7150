The Intel FM6000 <i>Alta</i> is the single chip silicon switch at the heart of the 7150S products.
The FM6000 was announced in November 2010; chip and product delivery took 2 years.
Of note, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010712/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/intel-fulcrum.png">Intel/Fulcrum switches</a> 
have capability to monitor buffer utilization with
millisecond granularity.  Arista makes this visible with their LANZ utility. As is
explained in <i>Arista Warrior</i>, among the merchant silicon switches, Intel is
way ahead in providing this monitoring capability.
<p>
<b>LANZ</b> can monitor the number of buffer blocks owned by a queue and spit out timestamp
reports when the queue length is above a user specified threshold. The reports can fob off
in many of the usual ways -- CLI logging to a local file, syslog, etc. The queue length can
be polled at sub-millisecond rates, so pretty short bursts can be seen.  LANZ is not
available for Trident+ products, and <i>Arista Warrior</i> explains that ability to
do this particular measurement is not built into the chip.

Intel's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010712/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/switch-silicon/ethernet-switch-fm6000-series.html">
product brief</a> on the FM6000
has a more modest claim of 8 MB <i>Shared packet memory size</i>. 
These could both be true if 9.5 MBytes is total packet
RAM and 8 MBytes is the size of the dynamic pool.  
But perhaps that is stretching too far...

Quoting from the Lippis Report (July 2013)
<p>
The three-year cost to power
the Arista 7150S-24 1/10GbE is estimated
at $546.74 and represents approximately
4.21% of its list price.
<p>
So, if you wanted to know the retail price, you could probably figure it out.
