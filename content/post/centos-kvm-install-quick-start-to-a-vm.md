I am a network engineer by profession, but with the proliferation of SDN and OpenFlow, I have had to spend a lot of time re-learning a lot of system admin skills that I'd shelved years ago.  Now, I've been a virtualization user forever. From [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) (Fusion, ESX), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), to [Parallels](www.parallels.com), I've used them at least in testing if not in production environments.  I'd not really spent any mentionable amount of time with [XEN](http://www.xen.org), [qEMU](http://www.qemu.org) or [KVM](www.linux-kvm.org), but some projects I was working on suggested it for the virtualization mechanism, so I figured I'd try to pick it up.  I think the hosting provider  of this blog is using it to provide the VPS that this site runs on, so it is clearly production quality.  In looking around for a straightforward how-to, a few things became obvious pretty quickly: KVM is very robust. KVM and qEMU have got a lot of documentation, but not all of it is straightforward. They have a lot of pieces needed to make it work efficiently. It wasn't a plug and run experience, by any means.  I wanted a headless, remotely manageable system that ran on a bare minimum install (i.e. no GUI).  After a late evening of hacking at it,  here is what I finally had to do to get it running and build a functional VM on a fresh install of CentOS 6.3. Install all the dependancies.  And there were many.  Coming from using the VirtualBox CLI, little things that I expected didn't work if I didn't have this or that installed.```
yum install -y qemu-kvm.x86\_64 qemu-kvm-tools.x86\_64 \\
kvm libvirt bridge-utils tunctl python-virtinst.noarch avahi
```Restart the deamons```
/etc/init.d/messagebus restart
/etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart
/etc/init.d/libvirtd restart
```Make the new daemons start at boot:```
/sbin/chkconfig messagebus on
/sbin/chkconfig avahi-daemon on
```

I want to bridge rather than NAT.  My VMs need to have a public (or same LAN segment) address as the rest of the hosts for external management and availability of inbound services.  For this, we need to adjust the interfaces.  I want to run the bridge on a second interface and keep the host system management on a dedicated interface.

```
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
```Your file should look something like this when done:```
DEVICE="eth1"
HWADDR="c0:ff:ee:c0:ff:ee" # (leave this as your MAC address)
NM\_CONTROLLED="yes"
 BRIDGE=br0
 ONBOOT="yes"
UUID="a9c26927-7650-42e9-a86a-1ae1227eac4b" #leave this as your UUID)
``````
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0
```

Your file should look something like this when done:

```
DEVICE="br0"
TYPE="Bridge"
BOOTPROTO="static"
IPADDR="10.10.10.50" # Use your own IP address
NETMASK="255.255.255.128"
GATEWAY="10.10.10.1"  # Provide your gateway
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6\_AUTOCONF="yes"
NM\_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
```

Restart the network to make it active.

```
service network restart
```You're going to use virt tools and virsh to manipulate the guests.  I tried it a few other ways and this seems far more supportable.  I wanted to install a CentOS 6.3 guest, I grabbed the install media from a [local mirror](http://cosmos.cites.illinois.edu/pub/centos/6.3/isos/x86_64/).  I have a volume mounted as /services that I keep stuff in.```
mkdir /services/vm/template-host
cd /services/vm/template-host
wget http://cosmos.cites.illinois.edu/pub/centos/6.3/isos/x86\_64/CentOS-6.3-x86\_64-bin-DVD1.iso
```Now use the virt-install command to boot the system with the following parameters: 2G of RAM 50G disk named disk.img Console redirected to a VNC instance on port 5901 Network interface attached to br0 4 CPUs CDROM points to install image```
virt-install --name template-host --ram 2048 --disk /home/vm/template-host/disk.img,size=50 \\
--graphics vnc,port=5901 --network bridge=br0 --vcpus=4 --os-type=linux \\
--cdrom=/home/vm/Install\_Media/CentOS-6.3-x86\_64-bin-DVD1.iso
```Now, to connect to the console, you'll need to tunnel VNC over ssh.  This can be adjusted, but that's outside of the scope of this. I like to redirect real port numbers for my own sanity.```
ssh -N -p 22 -c 3des buraglio@vmhost -L 5901/localhost/5901
```The above command will redirect localhost port 5901 to port 5901 on the host vmhost Connect to the VNC server:

Once connected you should drop right into the console of the KVM instance. Install as a normal system at that point.

Once installed It'll appear as a normal host console.

I found virsh to be the most useful for manipulating the virtual machine.

```
\[root@behemoth Install\_Media\]# virsh list
Id            Name                                      State

----------------------------------------------------

9              template-host                         running
```Helpful commands I found after 30 minutes of poking around and playing with virsh: virsh list --show the list of virtual machines virsh destroy <vm name> --hard shut down a host (I believe) virsh undefine <vm name> --remove the VM from registration --this one was hard for me to find.   [Here](http://www.forwardingplane.net/unix/kvm-virsh-command-referenc/ "KVM virsh command reference") is a complete list of the commands.
