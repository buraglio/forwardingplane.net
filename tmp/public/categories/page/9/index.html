        As much as I like to think I automate everything, I&#8217;m pretty bad at writing code to make my life easier since it tends to take me longer to write the code and it tends to make be a bit grumpy (this is eomthing I&#8217;m fixing by learning as much code dev as I can during my limited spare time). However, I like to think I can be fairly smart about working around my limited programming skills (think boba fett rather than jedi) by using the tools available to common folk.

        One of my biggest complaints about VMware is that it is an enterprise application. It has historically catered to the masses, which I completely understand, but those of us that aren&#8217;t a fortune 500 company are figuratively and operationally shoved into a corner and forced to find hackish ways of doing things to work around the enterprise nature.
One really, really good example of this is OS dependency. I hated architecture dependencies back in the old days (x86, SPARC, PPC) and I absolutely despise things that are OS platform dependent now.

        I want to preface this by saying that I have not seen or worked on the cumulus networks system yet. This is a stream of consciousness post on my thoughts and opinions based on what I&#8217;ve read publicly.
Recently a new network player has emerged on the scene with a very simple, straightforward idea. Take linux and put it on a switch. While this isn&#8217;t exactly new (see Juniper and FreeBSD, Arista with Linux, Force10 with NetBSD or the plethora of other vendors using an opensource OS as the underpinnings of their NOS), the angle that cumulus networks is taking is a bit more&#8230;.

        I had the need to build a FlowVisor instance under CentOS. Since nearly all of the docs I could find were for debian, I threw this together. I utilized this GENI doc and the github docs as a simple reference. This is the quick and dirty method I used:
Install the prerequisites:
sudo yum -y install ant eclipse java-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64 git sudo yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools" Create my standard directories:

        In many environments, the move to virtualization is a path well traveled. My home and lab networks are no exception to this and I&#8217;m sure nearly everyone who reads these pages has at least been exposed to it in one way or another. I have played with nearly all of the virtualization platforms and am firmly in the camp that there will be a large segment of networking that will move to a virtualized platform especially in the data center and campus segments.

        I have been learning and using IPv6 for a quite a while, even before I worked in research and education, back in the ISP days. I thought I should learn it because, frankly, I figured we&#8217;d all be converted to it by now, already whole hog using it like it was the layer 3 addressing mechanism that it is. Flashback: My first IPv6 access was via a tunnel to HE a long, long time ago and before that I was reading what I could about it.

        Working on some MX series routers recently I encountered a problem I&#8217;d never seen before, essentially preventing the configuration from being committed:
buraglio@rtr# commit check re0: error: could not open configuration database (juniper.data+) This is a very annoying problem and is terribly inconvenient as you can probably imagine. So, my first instinct is to drop down to the shell and starting hacking at it UNIX style.
buraglio@rtr&gt;start shell From there I wanted to see the file system and check out the stats of what it thinks we have.

        One of the things that I&#8217;ve always lamented about using non-Cisco hardware is the lack of true 1:1 netflow support. Say what you will about jflow, cflow, sflow&#8230;.there is no substitute for netflow, with sflow being the exception to that since it is a protocol that inherently supports ipv6 and can transport far more than simple network information if configured in certain ways on certain devices.
On newer MX series Juniper routers the game has changed.

        Let me be clear, when I say &#8220;single vendor&#8221; I&#8217;m talking about being &#8220;single vendor&#8221; in what you work on, not necessarily what you install (although one basically forces the other) and what I really mean is multilingual. I&#8217;ll explain after a brief history of why I am the way I am.
I&#8217;m idealistic but I&#8217;m also realistic. I generally propose solutions that I think are best even if it is non-standard or out of current comfort level along with an alternative or two.

        My personal background in computing (specifically networking) is atypical. I have a bachelors in visual arts and only took a handful of computing classes in my relatively long tenure in college. However, I did learn one valuable lesson that has served me pretty well over the 15 or so years I have been doing networking and I&#8217;d bet money any good network engineer that has more than 10 years of experience will nod their head at this and agree.
