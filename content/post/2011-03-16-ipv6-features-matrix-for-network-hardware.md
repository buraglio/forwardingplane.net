I've been doing a  lot of IPv6 stuff lately, and one of the things I didn't find (and kinda just wanted to put one together for my own benefit) is a matrix of features I thought were important to have on the IPv6 side for common network hardware.  Below is a work in progress of what I have so far, which will automatically publish changes from <a href="http://bit.ly/network-hardware-v6-feature-matrix">this spreadsheet</a>.  Please email me if you're interested in adding to this or correcting anything I may be incorrect on. <br /><br /><iframe width="500" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/buraglio.com/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0AkRPccDFxV1kdEVNNEhFbG9UZWJlNVJ4NHJlWGtWV1E&output=html&widget=true"></iframe><br /><br />This has evolved into something else entirely.  I've had a very good response to this very rudimentary start of a feature matrix and have decided that it's going to get expanded into whatever it needs to become.  I've added the start of a matrix for network security hardware / appliances <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/bit.ly/ipv6-security-matrix">here</a>. <br />I may eventually break this out into L2 and L3 as well as security appliances.<div>[[ This is a content summary only.
