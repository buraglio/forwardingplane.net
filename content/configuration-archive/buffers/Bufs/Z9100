First product announcement that uses the new Broadcom Tomahawk switch.
Trade press <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010749/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/dell-tomahawk.pdf">article</a> April 23, 2015. Dell has released
a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010749/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Dell-Networking-Z9100-spec-sheet.pdf"> data sheet</a> that specs
packet buffer at 16 MB.  The ports are all QSFP28. This is plug 
compatible with the older version of QSFP that had 4 ea 10 Gb/s lanes. 
"28" is the signalling speed of each lane required to get a payload rate
of 25 Gb/s. Tomahawk is capable of downshifting the speed of the lanes for
plug compatibility with 10G / 40G ports. The Z9100 will have an ONIE boot 
loader and the first available sofware will be FTOS, a Force-10 derivative. 
Dell expects other partners like Cumulous and Big Switch will also offer
compatible switch images.
