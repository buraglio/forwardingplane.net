As of Oct 25, this switch is not on the price list and so not quite orderable.
It is a 64-port 100 Gb/s switch with 16 ports capable of MACsec and two SFP ports. Two RJ-45 
ports for console and management Enet are on the rear [not shown]. Internally
it uses a single Tomahawk-II switch ASIC.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://clnv.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/usa/pdf/BRKDCN-3734.pdf">
