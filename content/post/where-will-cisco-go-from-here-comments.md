I have only a bit of experience with their server stuff. Overall I was left wanting, but you're right, it was back when they were rebranding. I do really think that it's a different world now and they're going to have to adapt or fade to a shell of what they once were. From a networking perspective, they gear is good....but it's operationally and fiscally expensive to run. In house knowledge is one thing, but having a good network team means that they are open to new idea and able to adapt. That doesn't bode well for a company riding on it's history and the sales team that just expects institutions to "just buy cisco because they always have". Fresh ideas, they need them. They need to pump as much money into fresh, new, hungry employees that want to change the world and come up with innovative ways of doing something and \*then\* leverage their marketshare.

Only point I'll take issue with is Cisco is doing big business with their in-house designed and built blade servers (UCS) with baked-in convergence and management. Yes, the servers they used to rebrand/resell were crap, but that was more a product of choosing IBM and HP AND then running their own build of Windows Server OSes that would get really long in the tooth (CallManager, MeetingPlace, etc).
