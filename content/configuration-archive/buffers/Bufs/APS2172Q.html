<b>Introduced: June 16 2021</b>
<p>
As noted in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010605/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/210616_APS2172Q_preliminary.pdf">data sheet</a> this is
<i>preliminary</i>. The diagram is misleading. This is a 2 RU switch. 
It is interesting because it includes an intel FPGA along with
Gigabytes of HBM memory which might be in the data path. This could be interesting.
