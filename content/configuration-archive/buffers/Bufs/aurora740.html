While there is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010626/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/aurora.pdf">data sheet</a>, it
is no longer linked off the bm-switch.com pages. It can
still be found with a google search. While the datasheet
says it supports SONiC, the switch appears to be missing
from the SONiC hardware compatibility list.

<b>Aurora 740 is listed as EOL on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010626/https://netbergtw.com/top-support/eol-products/"> netberg's EOL page</a></b>
