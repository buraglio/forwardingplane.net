<b>Product Release Date: June 7, 2019</b>
<p>
Built on the LS3600FX2 ASIC, this 2RU switch incrementally improves on the FX by adding 
flow table collection, Flow Table Events collection and streaming statistics export.

A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010753/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/C9300-FX2-dataheet.pdf">data sheet</a> covers all the
members of the <b>FX2</b> family. 
The dual slice ASIC will need some buffer to support the
internal connection between the slices, so it is likely that not all
the 20 MBytes is available for burst absorption. Cisco has not disclosed
the geometry of the ASIC but given the similarity of specifications
to the Nexus 9332C, I am guessing 16 nM.
