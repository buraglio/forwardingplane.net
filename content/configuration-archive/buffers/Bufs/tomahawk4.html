<b>Announced mid 2019, shipments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010636/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Tomahawk4-announcement.pdf">announced</a> Dec 9, 2019</b>
<p>
Broadcom has positioned this ASIC for the hypescalers that do roll-your-own switch development.
As such, no commercial products that use this part have yet been announced. Broadcom has yet
to spill the beans viz the amount of packet memory. In a February 2020 presentation in front
of Tech Field Day delegates, Broadcom made the point that the packet buffers are not 
segmented and attached to the four packet processors. Any of the RAM can be used by 
any of the packet processors. <i>The Linley Group</i> issued one of their  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010636/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/tomahawk4-linley.pdf">
reports</a> at the same time as the ASIC announcement.

<h3>Press Release December 2, 2020</h3>
