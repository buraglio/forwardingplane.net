    Let me save you some time&#8230;.Microflow Policing on the Catalyst 6500 / Sup2TXL doesn&#8217;t yet work. Inbound it &#8220;kinda works&#8221;. You can configure it and it applies as a service policy, but even though outbound is &#8220;supported in hardware on the Supervisor2TXL&#8221;, there is no software support for it in either the 15.0SY or 12.2(50)SY. It took me a month to suss this out&#8230;..
Yes, I should have suspected. I dont work on Cisco every day, I have Juniper MX, Brocade MLX and a multitude of other platforms to work on daily, so it took a bit.

    Moving to JunOS from IOS can be a daunting task. It&#8217;s a completely different command structure and the config, by default, looks like a programming language. I was fortunate enough to have gotten in on using JunOS very early in my career, 1&frasl;3 in to be exact (as of this writing). Not to mention that wen I got started, IOS wasn&#8217;t the only game in town. Remember Xylan? Gandalf? OpenRoute?

    As I sit here thinking if this site is worth my time, some words that someone said to me recently ring true. &#8220;Take from things you&#8217;re doing every day&#8221; is what Brent Salisbury of networkstatic.net said to me. He was right.
&#8230;And it was why I originally started this site, in a way. The original goal was to make a site I could take notes on and possibly help out someone trying to solve the same issues as me or look at something from the same perspective I had.

    If I had my perfect world where I lived in a gumdrop house with lollypop trees and everything smelled like butterfly kisses, here is what I would like to see in WAN networking gear. I can build a list for LAN and edge gear as well. It&#8217;s not a golden rocket ship I&#8217;m looking for. OK, maybe it is.  Full MPLS support   Full IPv6 support, all the features, not just pieces.

    Recently we&#8217;ve run into an odd issue while routing on an EX4200 series. These little JunOS boxes are a nice alternative for an entry level building router, they support L2/L3 functionality, a PVST+-ish protocol and, with advanced licensing, IPv6, ISIS and BGP. They have multi 10G interface options and come in a pluggable fiber option. We use them all over for light layer 3. They can also be stacked via stacking cables and fiber, which is very handy and makes them extremely versatile but not really applicable for the purpose of this entry.

    Every year there is an international conference for High Performance Computing, or HPC as it is often called. This is a bit of a niche in that it&#8217;s something that many enterprises and researchers need but don&#8217;t do themselves and so many don&#8217;t have a grasp as to what all is invoved. It&#8217;s a specialized, potentially expensive and very different environment as well as mindset than the general sysadmin or network engineer will ever see.

    Recently, there was a thread over at Packet Pushers about what folks use for their daily workflow. I quickly realized that my setup is pretty simple (as I like it) and relied on a large amount of terminal based tools, which makes sense since I have been a UNIX (or UNIX based) OS user since my migration from the original MacOS back in the 1990s. Anyway, Since I wrote most of this up already, I thought I&#8217;d post it here: Envoronment and Editing Editor: VIM via Terminal.

    Have you ever needed to replicate a lot of data transparently to an IDS without the use of a rack of optical taps? Not enough budget for a Gigamon or cPacket? Have a spare MLXe laying around? you&#8217;re in luck, we were in that boat too.
Let me first preface this by saying that this would be fairly trivial using OpenFlow / SDN. That being said, we didn&#8217;t have the time to set that up, so this is what we came with.
