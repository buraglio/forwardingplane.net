EZchip had a booth at the Nov 17, 2015 <i>White box strategies for CSPs</i> show in Santa Clara. 
Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ez-chip.pdf">NP-5 </a>
is a network switch SoC that uses external memory as its packet buffer. This sets it apart from <i>e.g.</i> Trident
and Tomahawk from Broadband. As an external memory device, it can have very generous packet buffers and therefore
very deep queues.
<p>
The NP-5 was announced in a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/EZchip-Press-release.pdf">2011 press release</a>. The announcement 
of volume shipments was made on December 22, 2014. Based on claimed
shipments in regulatory filings, it is clear that someone was buying
the NPUs. <i>Who</i> is someone harder to discern. Wisdom on the street
is that Cisco uses the NP-5 as a line card switching element on ASR9000 line cards. More information about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/EZchip-si.pdf">EZchip</a> is available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010716/http://www.siliconinvestor.com/">SiliconInvestor</a> web page. 

<p>
EZchip is a publicly traded Isreali company that is seriously considering selling itself to Mellanox.
Mellanox is also an Isreal-based company.  Mellanox 
makes switch chips with internal buffer memory, so this <i> merger</i> is understandable. <i>n.b.</i> this is
the wrong web page to get financial analysis. 
<p>
<b>Update</b>
<p>
19 January 2016: The acquisition by Mellanox will close in February. 
Selling price was $25.25 per share.
<p>
<b>Note added October 2019</b>
<p>
The NP-5 is now 8 years old, based on its announcement date. That is
[cough] a pretty long run for an ASIC. Broadcom introduced the Arad+
about the same time as the NP-5. Since then, we have Jericho, Jericho+,
and now Jericho2.
