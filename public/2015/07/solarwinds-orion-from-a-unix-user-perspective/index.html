            <div id="content">
                <p>Back in February of this year (2015) I was introduced to <a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/">Solarwinds</a> when they presented to us at <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/">Networking Field day 9</a>. Until then I knew of SolarWinds products but only at a cursory level; I had never really seen or used their stuff since it was mostly focused on environments that were either smaller or outside of the networking world that I generally operate in. However, I am a[n insufferable] network monitoring &ldquo;aficionado&rdquo; so when the opportunity to play around with it arose, I happily took it. Now, let me preface what comes next by laying out a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am not a fan of SNMP. In fact, I hate it. It&rsquo;s the least intuitive, overly complex protocol used for management that we can&rsquo;t get away from. It sucks and is CPU intensive. It is cryptic, dated and we&rsquo;ve tried to fix it by bolting on crude, poorly supported security features.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t do windows systems. I have not managed as much as a windows desktop other than an on-demand VM for the occasional DWDM network element manager since 1999. I have no issue with it as a platform but a unix based platform is a better tool for my every day workflow (see <a href="https://www.forwardingplane.net/topics/nix4neteng/">NIX4NetEng</a>)  so I don&rsquo;t have it in my wheelhouse and have no business managing such a system.</li>
<li>I went into this project completely and totally open minded. These were the canvas, brushes and subject I had to work with and it needed to do what needed done.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that out of the way, my impressions of SolarWinds Orion platform at first glance were: &ldquo;Wow, this is pretty good&rdquo;.<img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-10.48.05-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 10.48.05 PM" /> I must admit, I was surprised. Although I went in open minded, I knew that Orion is a tool that seemed to be enterprise focused, which was not the application it was being used for. It runs on windows systems, it had &ldquo;rumored&rdquo; scaling issues in large environments, and they market it mostly to the enterprise demographic, at least from my point of view. Admittedly I struggled with the configuration. I&rsquo;m a little old school and I like to kick the tires of a GUI and then to most of the heavy lifting in a conf file or set of files using VI, which I was not able to do here. I found the management a little clunky and sluggish at times, but the data presentation was top shelf and once I figured out the where and how I was able to set up netflow, syslog collection and up/down monitoring in pretty short order. In this environment I didn&rsquo;t yet have IPv6 so no sflow or IPFIX in the mix yet; not sure about IPv6 support in practice. A rough breakdown of the pros and cons from my inaugural run: <strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Elegant Interface</li>
<li>Eye candy</li>
<li>One stop shop***</li>
<li>Good support for common stuff, seems expandable.</li>
<li>Great <a href="https://thwack.solarwinds.com">community of support</a>; very &ldquo;FOSS-Like&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lots of knobs and dials for tuning.</li>
<li>Did I say good interface?</li>
<li>Automated netflow database maintenance is cool.</li>
<li>Search for flows and syslogs is reasonably fast. - a litmus test for real use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s SNMP. We&rsquo;re mostly stuck with that, unfortunately.</li>
<li>Interface configuration took a little getting used to coming from a CLI background (this is a &ldquo;me problem&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Cost; it&rsquo;s a reasonably noticeable capital expenditure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unknowns: </strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t get to play with the SNMP trap management.</li>
<li>I kept RANCID for configurations management.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key for this for me was that I did not need to manage the server. I had no access whatsoever to the underlying OS, meaning the responsibility of managing this host OS was completely off the table. I was able to manage the SolarWinds instance from its web interface without issue. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-10.47.36-PM.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-10.47.36-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 10.47.36 PM" /></a> My summary: If you are comfortable in a windows environment or do not manage the underlying system, don&rsquo;t need granular flow and syslog analysis for forensics and have the cash, it&rsquo;s a full featured, supported platform. I continue to learn more and more about the seemingly endless stuff this platform can do. If you are strapped for cash and/or are comfortable going the FOSS route, you have a lot of options at the expense of configuration time and possible learning curve. You&rsquo;ll spend the money wither way, either on people time or on licensing. In some cases possibly both. ** I&rsquo;ve heard that as a rumor. In my experience with the devices and other network elements it managed it seemed to work pretty well and I had no scaling issues. *** Depends heavily on needs and requirements.</p>
