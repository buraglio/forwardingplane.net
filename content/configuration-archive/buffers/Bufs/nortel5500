In their paper on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010721/http://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/incast.html">incast,</a> Yanpei Chen, Rean Griffith, Junda Liu,
Randy H. Katz and Anthony D. Joseph said:
<blockquote>
<i>To the best of
our knowledge, the Nortel 5500 series switch has a maximum
of 131072B of buffer space for each port, and 786432B total
buffer space shared between 48 ports.</i>

It is interesting that serious academic scholars need to hedge on
a detail that is central to the performance they are studying. It
is testimony to the difficulty of getting this information out of
manufacturers.

With Nortel's backruptcy, the ownership of the switch line was
purchased by Avaya. The Nortel 5300 family appears to have 12-port shared memory switch
modules connected with some sort of central switch. Early software
divided the packet memory into eight queues. Starting with version
4.0, command line controls were added that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010721/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/nortel-queues.pdf">
permitted reduction</a> of
the number of QoS levels and hence queues. This permitted fine tuning
of the packet memory distribution to match requirements. At the time
of the incast paper, the number of queues could not be reduced and
so the max burst absorbtion was 131 KB. Subsequent software permitted
this to be 786 KB.
