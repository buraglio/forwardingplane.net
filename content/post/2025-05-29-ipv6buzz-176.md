Point to point link addressing. One would think it to be a simple formula...but alas, like everything else, there are strong opinions and lots of options. In this episode, we chat about point-to-point links. We cover what should and shouldn’t be done, and discuss why following RFC’s doesn’t always get you to the right place. We dig into questions including, but not limited to

- Don’t we just use link-local addresses for point-to-points? Shouldn’t we assign a /127, just like we do a /31 in IPv4? 
- If not a /127 or /126, maybe a /80 or a /120 instead? 
- We also talk about whether RFC 6164 might be a bit outdated in terms of recommendations, and more.
