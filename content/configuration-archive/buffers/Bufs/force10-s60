The Force10 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010743/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Dell_Force10_S60_Spec_Sheet.pdf">S60</a> 
is a top of rack switch designed with 
truely deep buffers that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010743/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Force10_S60_Hot_Sheet.pdf">
specifically addresses</a> the congestion 
management requirement that derives from a downward speed step.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010743/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/s60-buffer-tune.pdf">Buffer tuning</a> is at the back of
the command reference manual. Controls that limit the maximum queue
depth can be adjusted. After all, 1.25 GBytes is a lot of buffer.
<p>
The Gig-E ports present at 44 RJ45 tw-pair and 4 SFPs. This may be in
deference to the top-of-rack application.  44 Rack Units is a full
7 ft cabinet.  The SFP+ ports are purchased two at a time as uplink
modules.
