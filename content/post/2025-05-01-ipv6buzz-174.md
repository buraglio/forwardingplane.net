On this episode of IPv6 Buzz, we have a very special guest, Tommy Jensen, a Senior Technical PM Strategist at Microsoft who is on to speak with us about IPv6 support in Windows. Tommy shares what he hears from enterprises that are moving toward IPv6-mostly, strategies for dealing with older applications and devices that expect IPv4, and how the customer conversations he’s having about IPv6 now are more engaged and serious compared to a few years ago. Lastly, we chat about his involvement with the IETF and some of the RFCs he’s currently working on.

Give it a listen!
