      <description>Anyone that looks at this site with any regularity may have noticed that I have been pretty remiss in adding posts - for that I apologize, things have been busy. However, I have not been absent in the tech world&amp;hellip;quite the opposite, in fact.

This recent story has sparked something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a very long time.</description>
