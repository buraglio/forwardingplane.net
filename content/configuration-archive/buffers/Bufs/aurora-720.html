Made by Netberg in Tiawan. This 1 RU switch has a Tomahawk 
BCM56960.

related to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010710/http://bm-switch.com/">bm-switch</a>. In fact,
Netberg claims that bm-switch is their <i>project</i>.  Web
page lists software options:
<li> Cumulus Linux</li>
<li> Broadcom ICOS</li>
<li> Ubuntu using Broadcom Libraries</li>
<li> IP infusion OcNOS</li>
<p>
Perhaps the most attention-getting feature is cost: $8000 (Jan 2016)
<p>
bm-switch lists the price as $6400 (July 2021)
