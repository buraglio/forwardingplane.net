Hints: The 25 Gb/s ports can use optical SFP28s, so this can't be Gen 1 Tomahawk.
It has 22 MByte of buffer which matches Tomahawk+ but not Cavium or Barefoot.
So, probably Tomahawk+.

There is a data sheet, but it isn't terribly helpful. Much better is the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010713/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/lenovo-NE2572.pdf">switch product guide</a> that has info
on data buffering.

Lenovo added a new part by appending the letter "O" to the number, so
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010713/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/NE2572O.pdf"> NE2572O.</a>  The "O" stands for ONIE which distinguishes from the 
original model that ran software named <i>Cloud Network Operating System</i> (CNOS).
