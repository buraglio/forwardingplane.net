<h2>Brocade ICX7150 and ICX7250</h2>
<p>
<b>Introduced December 2016</b>
<p>
The access switch products along with Ruckus Wireless were transfered
to Aris as part of the sale of Brocade assets to Broadcom. So these
are now Ruckus switches under a banner that says
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010734im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ruckus-dog.jpg" alt="Ruckus dog logo">
<p>
Not shown here, there are also 48-port varients for both of these switches.
In the table (24+2) means 24 RJ45 ports with PoE and 2 RJ45 ports without power.
<p>
Our understanding is that ICX switches with 7xxx model numbers have Broadcom ASICs 
as the core switching element and 6xxx are Marvell ASICs. There is no industry 
standardization of the stacking protocol. Each chip vendor has their own. That
the 7150 and 7250 can be stacked with the 7750 [known broadcom] but not the 6610
leads to a consistent picture.  
<p>
So, if this is a broadcom, which one ?? Perhaps some varient of BCM56340. Hard
to say. Probably a Helix varient rather than trident. With 1 Gig access ports, this 
is not an entirely exciting part. 
<p>
There are five varients of the 7150 and five more of the 7250. 24 and 48 ports;
with and without PoE. Details are in the data sheets:

<p>
Brocade is following the tradition of selling separate access to features as
extra cost licenses. Layer 3 features are not in the base price. And the right
to run the uplink ports at speeds above 1 Gb/s are likewise an extra-cost item.
Charging extra for features is an OK way to return value to the share holders.
But management of licenses and keys in an environment that is not entirely
homogeneous can be the number one technical assistance item.  We are not a fan.
