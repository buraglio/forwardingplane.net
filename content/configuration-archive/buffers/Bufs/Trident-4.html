<b>Trident-4 BCM56880</b>
<p>
<b>Introduced June 11, 2019</b>
<p>
As I write, this is very fresh. As is typical of Broadcom, we will 
not find out how much on-chip buffer it contains until switch 
products are announced. Typically, one year. Broadcom did
offer a nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010636/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/trident4.pdf">product announcement</a>.
The switch family can support 128 100-Gb/s ports or 32 400-Gb/s ports.
<p>
Accompanying the product blurb there is a 5 minute zippy
video. Extracting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010636/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/trident4-slide.jpg">single image</a> from the video, it seems
clear that there will be down-scale versions of the Trident4
intended for the top-of-rack switch market. Individual models
have not been announced. Within the ASIC, the pipeline is comprised
of identical match-action elements. This regularity of architecture
is compiler-friendly. Broadcom, perhaps seeing a competitive threat
from <b>barefoot networks</b> and P4, is a sponsor of an open source
programming language NPL or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010636/https://nplang.org/"><i>Network Programming Language</i></a>.

Lifted from one of the trade rag stories -- the Trident4
is built with 7 nm silicon.

The first product I can find is Juniper's QFX5130. The data sheet says
132 MB of packet buffer. September 2020. Trident4 comes in four flavors:
X11, X9, X4 and X2. The QFX5130 is an X11. The X9 has 82 MB of packet buffer.
