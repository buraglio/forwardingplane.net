I've recently run into a situation where there was no longer enough space in the FIB to handle both the full IPv4 global table and the full IPv6 global table.  We prefer to run a default-free network within this particular SP network, but in this case, until a hardware refresh can happen, we'll need to adjust that.  Given what we knew about the size of both tables, it made more sense to take a default IPv6 route from one transit provider and filter the rest.  How we did this isn't a groundbreaking marvel by any means, but it's probably worth writing down for someone else to reference since it also applies to IPv4.
Since we already have global tables, a request to add IPv6 default to our existing full IPv6 table was made to one transit provider.  After that request was fulfilled, filter adjustments were made.  It should be note that all of these configs were generated off of Brocade MLX routers, so they may look a tad different than an IOS device.
Create a prefix list to reference that will allow default:
<pre>ipv6 prefix-list V6-PERMIT-DEFAULT seq 5 permit ::/0</pre>
Create the route map:
<pre>route-map IPv6-TRANSIT-DEFAULT-IN permit 100
match ipv6 address prefix-list IPv6-PERMIT-DEFAULT</pre>
Add the route-map to the peer:
<pre>neighbor 2001:fd8:e00::2 route-map in IPv6-TRANSIT-DEFAULT-IN</pre>
Before:
<pre>Neighbor Address AS#  State Time  Rt:Accepted Filtered Sent ToSend
2001:fd8:e00::2 65001 ESTAB 15d10h34m  12003    0       14    0</pre>
After:
<pre>Neighbor Address AS#  State Time  Rt:Accepted Filtered Sent ToSend
2001:fd8:e00::2 65001 ESTAB 15d10h34m     1    12002     14    0</pre>
Now we'll need to filter the prefixes of every other peer to allow for only IPv6 routes sized /32 or larger:
<pre>route-map IPv6-BILAT-IN permit 100
 match ipv6 address prefix-list IPv6-PERMIT-ANY-32
 set community 65403:1425
 set local-preference 200
ipv6 prefix-list IPv6-PERMIT-ANY-32 seq 5 permit ::/0 le 32</pre>
Once applied to the peers this will limit the routes installed into the FIB.
Install them by adding the route-map to the appropriate peers:
<pre>neighbor 2001:db8:0:300e::1 route-map in IPv6-BILAT-IN</pre>

As you can see, peers on AS65164 and AS65381 are both filtering a large amount of traffic that is smaller than /32. Couple that with the inclusion of a default route and the traffic has a good deal of best path and a default for everything else. Its not exactly the most elegant, but it does solve a problem that folks may be seeing on aging equipment with limited resources.
