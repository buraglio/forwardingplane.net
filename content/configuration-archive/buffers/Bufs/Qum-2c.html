Design of these switches is underway but not finished. As such, you cannot buy them. They
were announced at the September 2019 Open Compute Project regional summit. Prototypes
are being tested with the Jericho-2C which we are told has identical pin out to the
planned Qumran-2C. 
The OCP session that introduced these switches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010741/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETOFf32w70E&amp;t=1458s">
