This 2 RU Jericho2 based switch has 40 x 100 Gb/s ports on its front panel.
It also has 13 x 400 Gb/s fabric interconnect ports that can join
multiple S9700-53DX chassis together through a <i>Ramon</i> fabric
switch to make a very very large disaggregated switch. Whether unused
fabric ports can be pressed into service as switch ports is not clear.
My guess is <b>not</b>. There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010714/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/S9700-53DX.pdf">datasheet.</a>
