<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010739/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AG9064.pdf">Introduced</a> at OpenCompute Summit March 2017.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010739/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Agema-AGC5648S-opencompute.pdf">Design submission</a> to OpenCompute.org
<p>
No data sheet yet. AGC5648 and AG5648 are entirely different critters. Based on slides
shown at the Summit, the switch has two Jericho+ switch ASICs, each with 8 GB of packet
memory. The switch has two BCM52311 external TCAM memories. This may be the first
use of the Jericho+ ASIC.
