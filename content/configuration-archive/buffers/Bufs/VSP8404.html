<h2>Extreme Networks VSP 8404</h2>
<p>
Extreme got the VSP family of switches as part of the Avaya Chapter 11 
restructuring announced in January 2017. The acquisition closed on 
July 17, 2017.
<p>
This is a 4-slot 2RU switch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010653/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/avaya-8404.pdf">At introduction,</a> it
was a 10 / 40 Gb/s switch. That was December 2016.
<p>
A reddit post from early 2017 said:
<blockquote>
I'm familiar with the VSP lineup, I guess my question was more directed at the fact that their core story is a bit lacking from my perspective, unless they have something new in the pipeline. VSP9k is pretty much dead. VSP8k and VSP7k are basically trident 2 boxes like everyone else has, max out at 24 qsfp+ on the VSP 8404. I don't see anything with 100Gbps but maybe I'm missing something.
I think the one unique thing is their support for SPB and the proprietary extensions that make it applicable for layer 3. In a lot of use cases people are attacking that now with an EVPN control plane and VXLAN instead.
</blockquote>
And, they <b>did</b> have something in the pipeline. In September 2017 the VSP8404C data sheet appeared. A new modular card 
now has 2 x 100G QSFP28. This seems like
a Trident2+ with a dual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010653/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/gearbox.pdf">gear box</a> chip. All previous cards from the 
VSP8404 are compatible with the 8404C.

<b>Packet Buffers</b>

<blockquote>
"<b>New intelligent buffer technology self-tunes thresholds for excellent burst absorption, offering a 5x efficiency gain over existing static designs.</b>"
</blockquote>
This leaves one to ponder what existing designs are compared against. Those 
words were written by Avaya before they sold the product to Extreme, but 
Extreme has not updated them.
