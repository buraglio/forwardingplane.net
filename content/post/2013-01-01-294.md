I am very happy and flattered that this site actually proves to be useful to folks. It was always my intention to use this as a platform to try to give back a bit, to help with any data I may have run across that was interesting, useful, or obscure.  I utilize sites like <a href="http://www.etherialmind.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etherialmind.com</a>, <a href="http://www.packetpushers.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packetpushers.net</a>, <a href="http://www.evilrouters.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evilrouters.net</a>,<a href="http://wwwmetworkstatic.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> networkstatic.net</a> and <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ioshints</a> more than I can even measure.  I wanted to try to contribute as much as I could to pay it back.  So, seeing at it's a new year and all, I couldn't resist doing some data mining on the analytics of this site over the course of the last 12 months. I was once again surprised to see that a firewall post was clearly the most popular.  The <a title="Sonicwall – Old dog learns [some] new tricks" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/sonicwall-old-dog-learns-some-new-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent post on the Sonicwall</a> was the clear, overwhelming winner having more than twice the views as it's closest rival.
<a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-295" title="rear_view_mirror" src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="442" /></a>
It's interesting to see that, especially since most of what I do every day is routing and switching.  However, when this site was originally brought online back in 2008 (as tech.buraglio.com) to house my <a title="Updating SRX IDP signatures" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/updating-srx-idp-signatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very</a> <a title="Juniper SRX Cluster" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/08/juniper-srx-cluster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rough</a> <a title="SRX IPv6 flow based processing" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/srx-ipv6-flow-based-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> <a title="Multicast through Juniper SRX 5800" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/multicast-through-juniper-srx-5800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on</a> <a title="Enabling IPv6 on Juniper SRX 5800 cluster" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/enabling-ipv6-on-juniper-srx-5800-cluster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the</a> <a title="Moving JunOS code between SRX cluster nodes" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/01/moving-junos-code-between-srx-cluster-nodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juniper</a> <a title="Upgrading a new SRX 3600" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/02/upgrading-a-new-srx-3600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SRX</a> platform that I had the pleasure of being a very early adopter of, it was really obvious that folks wanted to see that data.  Those posts, although somewhat old, continue to be pretty popular.
The <a title="Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us." href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/plexxi-could-be-wdm-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Plexxi</a> and the <a title="SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on SDN across the WAN</a> are also pretty popular and both are subjects I will likely revisit as time permits.
I'm working on many, many cool projects this year and I plan to write notes on every one of them.  Hopefully they'll be useful to someone.
