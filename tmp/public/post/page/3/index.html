        If anyone is interested in the talks I participated in at Joint Techs in Fairbanks, AK, they are now on the internet2 sites.
IPv6 feature support
IPv6 campus panel discussion
They&#8217;re apparently not embeddable, but can be watched from the Joint Techs site.

        It looks like MacOS 10.7 (Lion) has fully functioning DHCPv6. It&#8217;s about time.
Before:

After:

pfSense setup:

Using Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server 4.2.1-P1 as the server (on my pfSense box) I am able to get not only a privacy address (via stateless autoconfigure) but also a normal EUI-64 address as well as an IPv6 address via dhcpv6.
   I didn&#8217;t do anything except use the &#8220;Automatic&#8221; setting in the network control panel, so out of the box OSX 10.

        I&#8217;m not a fan of IPv6 privacy addressing. I understand the logic behind it, I really doo, obfuscate the LLADDR (MAC address) of the host in question, but I really dont&#8217;t see the realistic purpose. If someone wanted to use my mac address, what good would that really get them, unless they&#8217;re on the same layer 2 segment? More importantly, if they;re on the same layer 2 segment, they have my MAC address anyway.

        I&#8217;ve recently decided that even though I love the BSD style MacPorts system, it can be too clunky to maintain and doesn&#8217;t handle dependancies as well as I&#8217;d like (much like the actual BSD ports collection). So, in doing a little looking I found that Fink is still out of date, but Homebrew is very simple and also really elegant comparatively speaking.     Since homebrew doesn&#8217;t wrk well with other packge systems installed, and I already     I&#8217;d like to know what I had installed since this system has been in use for 2+ years, so I do a list and send it to a txt file:     touch ~/Documents/installed.

        Google has introduced a very powerful set of python based command line (CLI) tools called GoogleCL. This post was made using GoogleCL from my Mac. I highly recommend checking it out if you like to automate or script stuff.

        It&#8217;s no secret or ground breaking area to do black hole routing.
 ISPs and NSPs have been doing it forever to allow for a very low cost, very scriptable and very effective way to wholesale block a layer3 address. However, it can seem like a bit of a black box to anyone who has never done it.  I recently did some work spinning this up in a good sized network that it didn&#8217;t currently exist, and remembered how monumentally useful (and simple) it actually is.

        I have recently enabled Duo Security for many of my personal services, and I can&#8217;t recommend them enough. Personal two factor authentication is very useful and really powerful. It works on my iPhone and I have yet to run into any real issues&#8230;.except for one. I can&#8217;t use automation to scp or sftp anything anymore and keep my two factor auth working in a way I&#8217;m comfortable with.
Enter ftps. FTP is a terrible, yet immensely useful protocol.

        I had very high hopes for iMessage. With the release of iOS 5, one of the big new features was iMessage, the ability to do Blackberry messenger style messaging on an iOS device. I had really hoped that this would be something like wifisms or the DeskSMS app for Android. At the very least I was hoping for iChat integration with iMessage.
   This didn&#8217;t happen.     Don&#8217;t get me wrong, iMessage is still really cool.

        Recently I was poking around Mail.app, setting up my new machine. I like to keep redundant copies of everything, email being no exception. I have backups of all of my email dating back to 1998, for the most part. It has come in handy from time to time and I like it for reference reasons. It&#8217;s a small amount of actual data as far as space goes, and it&#8217;s easy to do.

        I&#8217;ve had a co-located server in one way or another for the last 11 years. From hosting a bare metal box at the ISP I worked for for a while, to sharing a bare metal box at a colo provider to switching to a VPS service, I&#8217;ve always had an &#8220;offsite box&#8221;.
I just wanted to post a quick &#8220;these guys are great&#8221; comment to my current VPS provider, ARP Networks.
