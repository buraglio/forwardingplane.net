<h2>Champion-O.N.E switches</h2>
<table width="600">
<tr><td>
Champion-ONE has its roots in selling 3rd party optical modules. They recently
have joined the ranks of white box resellers, picking up the Edge-corE line.
That the ODM behind the switches is Edge-core is based on reviewing specs and 
photos of the devices. It has not been announced. Of some interest here is
that the data sheets list the software that is supported with each of the switches.
<p>
Note that <i>trident2</i> and <i>trident2+</i> have different software lists. No
<i>trident+</i> products are listed as the ASIC was obsolete well before Champion 
began carrying Edgecore switches.
