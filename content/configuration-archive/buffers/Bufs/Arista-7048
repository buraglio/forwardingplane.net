Thanks to the <i>Arista Warrior</i> we know that the 7048 switches use 
a Petra switch chip.  Petra was introduced by Dune Networks which has
since been acquired by Broadcom. The 7048 has two Petra switches. One
controls 32 Gig-E ports and the other one controls 16 Gig-E ports and
the four 10 Gb/s uplink ports.
<p>
Arista offers a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010741/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/arista-7048-arch.pdf">white paper</a> that makes about the same case for deep
buffers as does Force10. Arista claims in their comparison chart
that 7048 has dynamic buffering.  That means it is a shared memory
design rather than virtual output queuing. Arista says the 7048
is a store-and-forward design that therefore does not have the
obscenely low latencies typical of Trident products.
