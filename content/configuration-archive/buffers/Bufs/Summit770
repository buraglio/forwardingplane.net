<p>
This switch was introduced on 13 November 2013 in an article in 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010613/http://www.lightreading.com/spit-%28service-provider-it%29/storage-servers-generic-it/extreme-joins-new-switch-parade/d/d-id/706588">Light Reading</a>. The article says this is a Trident II product. Certainly the speeds and feeds and introduction date supports this conclusion. To look at the front panel and compare it to Arista, the difference is whether you want your management ports on the left or right side of the data plane connections.
<p>
The data sheet and other promotional materials say nothing about packet buffering.  Our general advice is that -- if you application cares about provisioned packet memory -- you should find a vendor that specs that parameter.  <i>Probably</i> this is a Trident II that treats memory the same as other Trident II products. Why would you want the risk?
<p>
Another trade press article from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010613/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/extreme-770-2.pdf">SDN Central</a> 
makes the important point that knowing this is a Trident 2 switch does not 
tell you everything you need to know. Manufacturers have options and they 
can tune their products to fit their markets.
