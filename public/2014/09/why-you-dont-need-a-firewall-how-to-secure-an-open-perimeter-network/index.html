                <p>I admit that the title was meant to be inflammatory.  However, there are use cases that aren&rsquo;t terribly uncommon where an in-line security appliance is just not the correct tool for the job.  Someone once told me &ldquo;a firewall protects a network like a fuse protects an electrical circuit&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s mostly a correct statement. Firewall vendors will probably argue this and enterprise folks may discount this as heresy and call for burning me at the stake.  I can say, though, that the use of a firewall, IPS or other inline security appliance has presented many problems in many environments in my years as a network and security engineer and architect.    To that end, there are mechanisms for replacing the functions of a firewall and IPS with other options, which in many cases have a lower capital expense [although they may have a higher <em>initial</em> operational expense].  I&rsquo;ll outline them here, but before I do I want to re-iterate that NAT (PAT) is not a security tool, it&rsquo;s a translation tool.  Nothing more.  So, I will leave that out.  If you don&rsquo;t have appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 address space some of these things may need adjustments although they are still accomplishable by doing NAT on a border Layer 3 device.     Below is a talk that I gave at BroCon14 that is a rough outline of how to do this, if you don&rsquo;t want to spend 30 minutes listening to me talk about it, the clifs notes are bulleted below, but the context is all in the video so I encourage you to watch it before responding to my post. For those that want to take a look, here is the talk. Here are the bullets.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Announce only necessary resources </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>One can utilize routing to only expose the pieces of the network that need to be exposed.  If you have a /16 and on;y a /24 needs to be exposed, only announce that prefix.  This is not that different than a typical DMZ.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filter access to network, storage and management hardware</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Utilize best practice ingress filtering.  Follow <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38">BCP38</a>. You should be doing this anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Utilize host based firewalls</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a no-brainer.  Firewall as close to the resource as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Employ central host management</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Make your life easy.  Cloud providers do it and it&rsquo;s well documented nowadays.  There are <a href="http://cfengine.com/">many</a> <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">options</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Centralize logging and flow data collection</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Another no brainer, you should be doing this anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create baselines for traffic and activity</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Data is good.  Knowledge is power.  Baselines are useful for both anomaly detection and forecasting and it&rsquo;s not that hard to do it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deploy and tune IDS</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Passive IDS system[s] off of a TAP or SPAN are key to this kind of architecture.  See video for more details but there are a bunch of good options. I prefer <a href="http://www.bro.org">Bro IDS</a> but there are many players both commercial and FOSS.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filter with black hole routing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/10/black-hole-routing/" title="Black Hole routing">talked about this before</a>.  Automating this is key to making it function efficiently and it is a fantastic tool.  This can be done with BGP (traditionally) or with something innovative like OpenFlow.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make use of regularly scheduled external vulnerability scanning</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great way to verify your exposure and works for any sized network.  Highly recommended.</p>

<p>  Clearly this isn&rsquo;t for everyone, and that&rsquo;s ok.  For anyone that has struggled with issues involving security appliances either based on protocol, horsepower or interface speeds, there are options.</p>
