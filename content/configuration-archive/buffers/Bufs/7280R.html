Networkworld thinks this as based on the Broadcom Jericho switch chip. They said:
<p>
<ul>
The products leverage the Broadcom Jericho chipset which is optimized for 100 Gig-E, deep buffers and routing. 
</ul>
<p>
A January 2016 posting on NANOG said:
<p>
<ul>
The BCM88670 (Jericho) is what powers the new Cisco NCS55XX devices. The processor 
is linerate above around 100 bytes per packet without external TCAM, supports 256K 
IPv4/64K IPv6 FIB entries (or mixed amounts). These chips are being used for high 
scale 100G, the initial NCS5508 linecard is a 36x100G QSFP28 one. 
<p>
Juniper has chosen to use their own silicon for most of their dense 100G platforms, 
but you will see these chips used by pretty much everyone else I imagine at some point in
the next year.

Arista has an extra cost software option called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010801/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/FlexRoute-WP.pdf"> FlexRoute</a> that works like hamburger
helper. It dilutes and extends the expensive TCAM [hamburger] to make it appear that
there is more than it first appeared. With <i>helper</i>, 256K worth of TCAM is 
stretched to cover 1M routes, along with a promise that future recipes may cut
that even further.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010801/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7280R-DataSheet.pdf">Data Sheet</a> 
We think of this as a fixed configuration version of the 7504R
chassis switch. Note that the 7280R data sheet does not support speeds lower than 10 Gb/s. It is possible 
that the switch family might have 1 Gb/s on some ports, the data sheet not withstanding.
Arista ran a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010801/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84RmatCDdls&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;submissionGuid=d41ae85a-5ef6-4cb6-aec8-0f1d605f43f2">
use case webinar</a> on June 16, 2016. It says little about switch internals.

[June 2016] Kernelsoftware shows a list price for the 7280TR of $29,995. Compare with similar
version from the previous generation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010801/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7280SE"> 7280SE-68-R</a> $39,995.
