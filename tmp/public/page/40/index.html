    A while ago I got an email asking me to participate in Network Field Day 7. I was very happy and humbled to get asked again since I wasn&#8217;t able to attend NFD5 or NFD6 for various reasons outside of my control (although I did try to participate with NFD5 remotely). If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the tech field day series, you should spend a little time and learn about the value it brings.

    “Hopefully there are some things here that will make you really upset in a very good way” is how Carl Moberg of Swedish based company tail-f opened up to the crowd at Networking Field Day 7 on Feb 19, 2014. Tail-f is a sleeper, I had actually never heard of them before NFD7, but they&#8217;ve got a very unique product in NCS and in my opinion it can change the way existing and future networks are managed.

    I recently had the displeasure of dealing with a series of failed disks in my newly created ZFS based NAS. I had cobbled together roughly 12TB of disk space and jammed them into an old PC, stretching the limits of the platform when I decided to go with ZFS. I broke all of the rules, underpowered, single core PC, only a handful of GIG of non-ECC RAM, etc. I&#8217;m sure storage guys are having a coronary after reading that, but it works for me and has minimal issues since I just relatively redundant need bulk storage and it doesn&#8217;t need to be fast (the ethernet connection is only 100M).

    Time to rewind from the new and shiny and get back to roots of networking. BGP is one of those odd protocols that is foundational to the functioning of the internet but yet somewhat hard to get experience with. Say what you will about this venerable protocol, it&#8217;s been here a while and it is not going anywhere any time soon. I&#8217;ve been doing BGP since around late 1999, and I completely fell into it by accident, having only the Cisco Internet Routing Architectures book (which I literally read cover to cover) and the Ulysses Black Routing Protocols Book and whatever I could find on a random search engine to guide me, and that was only after having to learn on the CLI for the first 6-7 months.

    I firmly believe that blending disciplines is the way of the future in IT. I&#8217;ve rambled about it here at other venues and I&#8217;m vocal (some would probably say brash) about it on the twitters. Be it Networking and System, Systems and Security, Programming and Networking, most of us that have been around any length of time already do it but now it&#8217;s happening out in the open and &#8220;DevOps&#8220;, a form of the hybrid IT worker, has seemingly become the BOTD (Buzzword of the day).

    Many network engineers are also tasked with maintaining systems that provide network services, those things that make the network easier to use such as DNS and DHCP or management systems that perform useful things like monitor the network, collect flow data or bestow access to the equipment by acting as bastion or jump hosts. In many instances, robust and high availability services run on UNIX, Linux or BSD systems for stability and reliability, so those that manage these systems need to be well versed system admins as well as whatever their other job functions are.

    Many regular internet users are extremely upset about the recent proposed changes the FCC has opened for comments about the delivery and provisioning of internet services. Watch this video if you&#8217;re unaware of the high emotions it has evoked:
While these are proposed rules and are not in any way finalized, there is real concern that they may become law. Where this is problematic is that it opens up the possibility of some real misuse, abuse or simple misunderstanding of needs and services.

    I don&#8217;t care what your vendor alignment of choice is, Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, Alcatel&#8230;.it doesn&#8217;t matter. At one point or another you&#8217;re going to need to bird dog an address to see where it&#8217;s coming from, who owns it, what it&#8217;s DNS name is or what path you&#8217;re taking to get to it. We&#8217;ve already talked about BGP tools, they&#8217;re a great choice for checking routes across the internet. Hunting down addresses is an interesting one, though, as address management and lookups can bleed into other aspects of networking like path selection, latency, jitter and many other things.

    With the recent announcement of Cisco Systems intent to purchase tail-f, proponents of a multi-vendor environment are waiting with baited breath to see how the networking giant will deal with support of competitor hardware and CLIs.
Yang is here to stay, there is no doubt about that. As is netconf. Both of these are good things for the industry as a whole, having a standard way to communicate with network hardware [that isn&#8217;t openflow] is necessary and immeasurably useful.
