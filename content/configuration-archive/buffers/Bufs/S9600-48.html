If it helps, the SerDes on the ASIC run at 50 Gb/s. The switch has 12 reverse gearbox chips
which can present 96 lanes as 48 100 Gb/s QSFP28 ports. Sadly, it does not appear that
there is a datasheet. There is, however, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010756/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ufiSpace-S9600-48X.pdf">
 OpenCompute design package.</a>
<p>
While the Jericho2 ASIC does have 112 fabric ports it appears that these are not brought
out as panel jacks. For access to the fabric ports, see the S9700-53DX
