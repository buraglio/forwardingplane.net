<h2>Aurora 620</h2>
<p>
The Netburg Aurora 620 is available with Broadcom's ICOS switch software for $7500 or as an ONIE boot loader for $5500. ICOS loads on top of ONIE, 
so you can figure the cost of ICOS. ICOS is an implementation of OpenNSL
so it might be free for those that can type 'make.' There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010739/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/leaflet-nba720-630-620.pdf"> datasheet.</a>
