In a triumphant return, Ivan Pepelnjak has resurected the Software Gone Wild podcast! As some may recall, I was a co-host on SGW for quite a while, eventually branching out into the [MODEM.show](https://www.modem.show) in around 2020. Well, MODEM has concluded, and SGW has returned. 

It was quite fun to "get the band back together" and record this one. 

From the [podcast post](https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/12/v6ops-ietf-working-group/): 
> The first IPv6 specs were published in 1995, and yet 30 years later, we still have a pretty active [IETF working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/v6ops/about/) focused on “developing guidelines for the deployment and operation of new and existing IPv6 networks.” (taken from the [old charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-v6ops/05/); they [updated it](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-v6ops/06/) in late October 2025). Why is it taking so long, and what problems are they trying to solve?

> Nick Buraglio, one of the working group chairs, provided some answers in [Episode 203](http://media.blubrry.com/ipspace/stream.ipspace.net/nuggets/podcast/Show_203-IETF_v6ops_Working_Group_with_Nick_Buraglio.mp3) of the Software Gone Wild podcast.
