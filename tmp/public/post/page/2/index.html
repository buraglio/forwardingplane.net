        I recently needed to upgrade a few MX480 routers and decided that it would be a good opportunity to get some experience with Juniper&#8217;s in service software upgrade.
I&#8217;d read a bit about it but I&#8217;d not had the chance to really use it. It&#8217;s pretty straightforward and it does what it claims. The following are my notes from rolling through this on my test lab MX480.
A few things are necessary to get going with ISSU, first and foremost, you need to have a box with two routing engines.

        Regardless of the fact that there is now a good ISSU-like service for the SRX (named Low-Impact Cluster Upgrade; LICU for short), if you&#8217;re upgrading your Active/Active cluster from something that isn&#8217;t 10.4, or if you just aren&#8217;t comfortable with how baked LICU actually is, you&#8217;ll need to know how to move the junos code around. This is easy if you have physical access to both nodes, but for those that have.

        I was recently helping my brother-in-law out with the new Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drivehe had purchased to do time machine backups on his mac. I personally have the 2t version and have been pretty happy with it, save for one small incident that I think was my fault that required some basic data recovery.
Since the drive comes in a file system that is not HFS+ Journaled, it needed to be reformatted to support time machine backups.

        We are putting a few new SRX 3600 clusters into production soon, and we&#8217;ve had them for about 6 months in boxes. This presented a fairly significant issue, one that I didn&#8217;t think about until it smacked me in the face.
The code on these boxes was old. Very old. JunOS 9.2 old.
No problem, lets just upgrade them to 10.4R something.
 Wrong.     the code that shipped on these boxes was so old, and we waited so long to upgrade them that I was unable to upgrade them straight to anything modern.

        I have huge iPhoto and iTunes catalogs. This can present a problem for both loading the applications and for backup. I have learned to deal with the Application load times, but backups are very important to me.     I&#8217;d gone through the iPhoto backup process and restore more than once, and I didn&#8217;t like the fact that I didn&#8217;t have an offsite backup, so I paid for a flickr pro account ($24/yr, supports iPhoto export and RAW format).

        I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of IPv6 stuff lately, and one of the things I didn&#8217;t find (and kinda just wanted to put one together for my own benefit) is a matrix of features I thought were important to have on the IPv6 side for common network hardware. Below is a work in progress of what I have so far, which will automatically publish changes from this spreadsheet. Please email me if you&#8217;re interested in adding to this or correcting anything I may be incorrect on.

        I found most of this on a web page somewhere tha tI can&#8217;t seem to find again. Below are some common useful junos tidbits regarding routing tables and interface types/names:
JunOS CLI supports the basic grep command (like | include) so any show commands can be grepped. I believe the grep command implies the -i flag for case insensitivity.
The routing table is presented in such a way to group types of routes.

        I&#8217;ve been a *BSD user since around 1997, when I installed NetBSD on a Mac SE 30 that I got for free. I was always intrigued with alternative operating systems like BeOS, *BSD, Plan9 and Linux so it made sense that I&#8217;d poke around with different systems.
 I&#8217;d gone back and forth from OpenBSD to FreeBSD but eventually settled on FreeBSD as my OS of choice. I ran it as a desktop before MacOS X came out and was generally happy with it.

        I did some minor tweaking to the Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts and some modifications to make RANCID work under my pfsense environment (originally m0n0rancid code from John Skopis). Since I don&#8217;t really do much dev work and am not interested in maintaing a box do be an SVN server for the public, I threw it up onto google code.
I&#8217;ll be adding a brief how-to on making RANCID work with pfSense as soon as I get some time.
