Many resources exist in order to test and report on IPv6 availability. One such site - [test-ipv6.com](https://www.test-ipv6.com) - has been a staple for nearly 15 years. This site has a robust mirror network and has been proudly advertising free since its inception. However, running such resources can be costly in both time and money. Recently, the author and maintainer of the site had announce its retirement. This sent some shockwaves through the IPv6 community that eventually culminated in a realization that we rely on something that isn't necessarily funded or permanent. since that announcement, someone has been able to take it over, however, the lingering feeling of "this could go away" still remains. To that end, I wrote a mediocre replacement for it and deployed it as the front page of [ipv6.army](https://www.ipv6.army). While not quite the same, it does provide an additional browser based test that may be useful to some, and just like this site, it is deployed on the netlify CDN.
