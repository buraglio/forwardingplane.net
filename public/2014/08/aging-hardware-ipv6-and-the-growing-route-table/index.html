<p>&ldquo;I would like to say that it will help the adoption of IPv6, because it may bring some attention to the fact that IPv4 addresses are being exhausted, but IPv6 has completely failed to take off,&rdquo; Cowie said. &ldquo;If anything, it really shows you that IPv4 has really never been healthier.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to think that this is a true statement, but history has shown that people only try to prolong the inevitable IPv6 deployment. If we worked half as hard at rolling out IPv6 as we did trying to work around it we would have been done years ago. &ldquo;Never been healthier&rdquo; is a relative statement, too, I think I could argue that the opposite of &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; as a descriptor for IPv4. &ldquo;In use&rdquo; yes.
