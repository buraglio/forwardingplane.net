<b>Announced 31 October 2018</b>
<p>

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010552/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/datasheet-GX.pdf"><b>GX</b></a> series appears to be a new spin of the LSE ASIC with more
packet buffer memory. The data sheet refers to this memory as <i>centralized</i> which seems to imply
that all the memory is accessable by all the ports.  At this writing the switches are not yet orderable.
<p>
<b>Orderable:</b> Feb 2020 from itprice list history
<p>
Not withstanding the characterization of the memory as <i>centralized</i>,
BRKDCN says that the ASIC has a slice architecture.
