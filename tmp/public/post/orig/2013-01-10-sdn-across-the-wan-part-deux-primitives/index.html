    <div class="content"> <p>I&#8217;ve been <a title="SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/" target="_blank">lamenting about the SDN WAN</a> options for a while now.  Having SDN/OpenFlow in a data center or campus is relatively well documented and already widely deployed.  Google has been doing SDN across their private WAN in production.  These pieces are easy.  What isn&#8217;t easy is the ability to plumb SDN across many domains that are under disparate control.   This part is hard. What is lacking is a fundamental framework, or set of primitives to build from.  As an example, how does one build a SDN path across this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-351" title="SDN Reference Architecture -Sanitized" src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png" alt="" width="470" height="704" srcset="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png 470w, http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>First I think we need to define what we want out of the SDN path.  A reserved bandwidth allocation?  A Layer2 path?  Flow instantiation across the entire path?  The first two have a least common denominator.  The third is hard, especially if the path transits a segment with no SDN capability.</p>

<p>This piece is making my brain hurt.  There seems to be a lot of early work on this, <a href="http://events.internet2.edu/speakers/speakers.php?go=people&amp;id=2865">Inder Monga</a> from <a href="http://www.es.net">ESnet</a> has been working at making this happen, and I think he&#8217;s the closest from what I&#8217;ve seen in my searching and researching.   I want to know how to do this across <strong>all</strong> networks.   I want to see the future of carrier WAN connectivity, to taste the unicorn milk.</p>

<p>The methodology so far has been to break this down into small black boxes.  After doing that, I realized that there is going to have to be a common protocol.  The least common denominator to all of this is the SDN.  It doesn&#8217;t much matter what that SDN is as long as there is a central controller.  It can be OpenFlow, <a href="http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/" target="_blank">OSCARS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Multi-Protocol_Label_Switching" target="_blank">GMPLS</a>, <a href="http://ext.delaat.net/olex/index.html" target="_blank">Open LightPath Exchange</a>, whatever.  It doesn&#8217;t matter.  They all need a controller.  Within those controllers there needs to be &#8220;an energy field created by all SDN. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together&#8221;.  Yes, I like Star Wars.</p>

<p>So, how would one do this?  It would be ideal, to me at least, if there was a standard set of protocols that all of these controllers could speak.  This standard communication could be as simple as how a BGP peering functions.  Site A has a controller, it &#8220;peers&#8221; with it&#8217;s upstream and announces its capabilities.</p>

<p>For example,<br />
<a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-352" title="SDN peering" src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png" alt="" width="591" height="740" srcset="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png 591w, http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering-239x300.png 239w, http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering-550x688.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></a></p>

<p>All of these peers exchange capability information and pass it on with a standardized set of language and a location identifier (think ASN and route announcements).  To me this appears to be the lowest hanging fruit. I&#8217;m not a developer but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be to be any reason that this couldn&#8217;t be built into any controller, commercial or opensource. That way, regardless of vendor, SDN implementation or capabilities everyone can create a SDN path based on the available implementations upstream. Of course, there would need to be a &#8220;multihop&#8221; option for those that have to upstream SDN paths. In this case something like a GRE tunnel could be the lowest common denominator. This would have to transcend OpenFlow and be a true &#8220;SDN&#8221; at the fundamental level to actually work, but it needs to take into account managing the flow table of networks outside of a given administrative domain. As a starting point, here is the framework I came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliable transport: TCP</li>
<li>Authentication method: MD5 Capabilities exchanged:</li>
<li>Number of circuits</li>
<li>Types of SDN (MPLS, VLAN, DWDM Waves, OpenFlow Version, Flow manipulation)</li>
<li>Bandwidth per circuit (if applicable)</li>
<li>Duration of circuit or flow (path TTL, permanent?)</li>
<li>Path validation (to ensure end to end connectivity over negotiated methodology)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve been talking a lot with <a href="http://www.networkstatic.net/" target="_blank">Brent Salisbury</a> about this.  I know folks are thinking about it.  Bill Owens <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/#comment-47">had some great comments</a> to my last post regarding this and I think he&#8217;s totally spot on.  However, I want to hit 88mph in my Delorean and see the future.  I think it&#8217;s a ways way off but someone needs to come up with this framework.  SDN is so disjointed that it needs a one ring.  Controlling the forwarding plane of someone else network is scary and needs to have a leash on it.  Building this standard protocol could be it.  Unfortunately, I am no developer but I do know a little bit about running a decent sized network.  There will need to be safeguards, policy and knobs to tweak.  I keep coming back to BGP.  It&#8217;s not as much of a routing protocol as it is a policy framework disguised as a routing protocol.  There needs to be something similar with SDN.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to continue to think through this publicly and I welcome constructive input.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-alto-protocol/" target="_blank">ALTO</a> is pretty close.  There has been a lot of work going on but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all the way to where we need it to be.  Some interesting proof of concept and detail stuff can be read <a href="http://www.ewsdn.eu/presentations/ALTOwrtSDN.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://opennetsummit.org/talks/ward-wed.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
