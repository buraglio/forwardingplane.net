<h2>Edgecore AS7900-32X</h2>
<p>

<b>I believe that AS79xx and AS97xx are the same product. At the point where 
Edgecore had to get materials ready for the 2018 OCP trade show the part 
number had not yet jelled. References to the older part number (79xx) have 
not been followed with any products.</b>
<p>
Introduced at OpenCompute Summit on March 20, 2018. The
Tomahawk III BCM56980 switch was featured in a keynote address by Edgecore
and shown on the show floor. Not clear why you'd want a Freescale
processor with a Tomahawk III, but I guess it's nice to know
it's an option.  It appears that a full design package will
be submitted to OCP and then this page will get fixed up. Showing
two part numbers <i>AS7916</i> and <i>AS7900</i> is consistent with
previous OCP submissions. There is no data sheet yet; it should appear
just before the switch enters the supply chain.

In the trade show floor photo below, most of the ports have
blue loop-back plugs. Availability of the switch is ahead of
the optic modules that will be needed to warm its DD QSFP slots.
