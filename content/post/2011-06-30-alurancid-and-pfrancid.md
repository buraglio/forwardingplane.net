I did some minor tweaking to the Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts and some modifications to make RANCID work under my pfsense environment (originally m0n0rancid code from John Skopis).  Since I don't really do much dev work and am not interested in maintaing a box do be an SVN server for the public, I threw it up onto google code. <br />I'll be adding a brief how-to on making RANCID work with pfSense as soon as I get some time.  <br /><br />The scripts can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/alurancid/">Alcatel-Lucent RANCID</a><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pfrancid/">pfSense RANCID</a><div>[[ This is a content summary only.
