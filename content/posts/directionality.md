    As I sit here thinking if this site is worth my time, some words that someone said to me recently ring true. "Take from things you're doing every day" is what [Brent Salisbury](http://www.twitter.com/networkstatic) of [networkstatic.net](http://www.networkstatic.net/) said to me. He was right.  
    ...And it was why I originally started this site, in a way. The original goal was to make a site I could take notes on and possibly help out someone trying to solve the same issues as me or look at something from the same perspective I had.  I do a lot of self study and tinkering in my home lab.  I also do a lot of off the wall things day to day.  I also do occasional consulting, when it's interesting.  Taking notes on these things is probably useful to at least someone.  
    However, there is a lot of content out there saying a lot of the same stuff and in better, smarter and more digestible ways that I can. There are numerous Cisco focused sites that are far better than I could hope to produce in my nearly non-existent "free time".  I know because I frequent many of them to help me.  [IOSHints](http://blog.ioshints.info/), [Networking Nerd](http://networkingnerd.net/), [Packet Life](http://packetlife.net/) are all fantastic resources.  Another of my favorite reads is [Evil Routers](http://www.evilrouters.net/).  It is sort of a unique bird, while the others are a tad cisco focused (not entirely, but mostly), [Jeremy Gaddis ](https://twitter.com/jlgaddis)throws in all kinds of amazing networking info in a well written manner and adds a significant amount of spice that is what I can only believe is his personality (I've never met him).  I can't \*not\* read it.  I utilize these resource, in addition to [Network Static](http://www.networkstatic.net/) and [Packet Pushers](http://packetpushers.net/) almost daily.  I hope this can be a shadow of those sites.  If something from my never ending, incoherent rambling can help out one person in a tight bind or a day-to-day problem, then I'll consider it a success.  
  
    Back to the point.  
  
   Enter this unkempt little corner of the internet.  Given that there is a bit of a lacking presence of non-cisco focused informational sites out there, maybe I can add some value......or at least not detract.  Lets start with two things I've found useful.  One is something I'm always looking for and never seem to bookmark.  [JTAC Recommended Junos Software Versions](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB21476).  This is invaluable, and unless you're doing something bleeding edge or edge case, this is a fantastic page to bookmark.  The other is a good resource for HP H3C networking gear.  [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jszc) knows his stuff and likes to [share it on his blog](http://thenetworkmonkey.blogspot.com/).  He also knows a lot about other HP gear.
