the OpenCompute Demo was held in March 2017.

<ul> Agema seems to have a hard time with data sheets.
At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010759/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/agema5648.pdf">introduction,</a> they claimed that this was a Tomahawk with 12 MB packet
memory. That has been corrected to 16 MB in some places. In October 2017
they published an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010759/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AG5648_IG.pdf">installation manual</a> 
that says there are now two varients:

<tr><td> AG5648</td><td> BCM56963</td><td> Tomahawk</td></tr>
<tr><td> AG5648V1</td><td> BCM56967</td><td> Tomahawk+</td></tr>

</ul>
The December 2017<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010759/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AG5648&#32;and&#32;V1-rev2-datasheet.pdf"> data sheet </a> does
not list any functional differences between the new and old models.  In Feb 2018
Colfaxdirect showed a web list price of $4550 without making a clear distinction
of which model they were selling.
<p>
The difference is that BCM56963 has interoperability problems with 25G ports.
The bugs were fixed in BCM56967.
