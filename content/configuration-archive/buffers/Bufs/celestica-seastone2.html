<h2>Celestica Seastone2 DX031 Trident3-X7</h2>
<table width="700">
<tr><td>
Celestica is a Canadian OEM or ODM. As noted in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010737/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/celestica_datasheet_seastone2E.pdf">datasheet,</a> the
switch comes with an ONIE loader and that pegs it as a disaggregated
product. Celestica, however, does not disclose its ASIC supplier
in the datasheet. That this is a Trident3 comes from the SONiC
hardware compatibility list.
