<p>
Note that the DX4 QSFP-DD module slots are smaller than the PX4 OSPF slots.

<i>first ship</i> date. Shipping should happen soon.
<p>
These Trident 4 switches have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010732/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7050X4-Datasheet.pdf">datasheet.</a>
A modular 8-slot cousin of these switches was introduced at the same time.
