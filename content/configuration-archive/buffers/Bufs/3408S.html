<b>Announced 31 October 2018</b>
<p>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010623/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cisco-3408-S.pdf">Nexus 3408-S</a> is a 4-RU modular version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010623/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/3432D.html">Cisco 3432</a>.
Each slot can accept either a 4-port 400 Gb/s card or a 16-port 100 Gb/s card. The switching capacity is the
same as its 1-RU cousin. In a mixed 400G and 100G environment, the mess of splitter cables can be avoided. I
believe this is an Innovium Teralynx ASIC for the same reasons as the Nexus 3432. The switches were announced
in a common press release.
