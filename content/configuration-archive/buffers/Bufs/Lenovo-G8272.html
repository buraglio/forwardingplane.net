<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/lenovo-G8272.png" alt="picture of 1 RU switch">
<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ENUSJG15-0079.PDF">Introduced</a>  April 7, 2015</b>
<p>
12.2 MB of packet buffer is a clear mark of a Broadcom Trident-2.
<p>
There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/rackswitch-g8272-datasheet.pdf"> data sheet,</a> but it isn't terribly helpful. Much better is the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/lenovo-G8272.pdf">switch product guide</a> that has info
on data buffering. Note that the word <i>ONIE</i> does not appear
in the product literature. The switch is available with two software
loads: <i>enterprise</i> and <i>cloud</i>.
<p>
The introduction date indicates the Lenovo was late to the party
relative to other vendors. I don't think they did anything wrong --
they were not in the first wave. This switch has a logical
successor with an amazingly similiar front panel layout.
