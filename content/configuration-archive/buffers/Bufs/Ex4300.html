The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010610/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ex4300.pdf">datasheet</a> in spite of its length
does not disclose the packet buffer memory. The datasheet says
that the switch has a single switching ASIC which they refer
to as the EX-PFE. I suspect, however, that this is actually
a Marvell ASIC and not Juniper custom silicon. Other information
on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010610/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Juniper-buffers.pdf">
EX buffers</a> from NANOG.
