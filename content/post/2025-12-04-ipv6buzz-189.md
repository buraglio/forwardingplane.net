The newly published [RFC 9898](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9898.pdf) is the discussion of today’s podcast. The IPv6 Buzz crew explore the complexities of neighbor discovery and review solutions for both operators and architects. They share how this RFC serves as a single, detailed resource to improve your understanding of neighbor discovery and to reduce the potential attack surface in your IPv6 networks.
Neighbor Discovery is one of the more complex pieces of IPv6 and this document aims to provide clarity on nearly all aspects of how it works. This ain't your grandfathers ARP.

Full disclosure, I was one of the co-authors of this RFC =)
