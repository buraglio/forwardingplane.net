<h2>AS5812-54X Trident 2+ switch from Accton</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5812.png">
<p>
The SFP+ model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5812-54X_ONIE_DS_R01_20160707.pdf">AS5812</a> was introduced on 7 July 2016. 
A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5812-54T&#32;ONIE&#32;DS&#32;R01&#32;20160411.pdf">10G-baseT model</a>
was announced in April 2016. 
While the Trident2+ has the capability of hosting 100 Gb/s ports, Accton
has not done that here.  
More info on Trident2+ is in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/trident2.html"> ASIC page</a>. Uses BCM56864 with Intel Rangeley C2538 x86 CPU.
<p>
This switch is the successor to the AS5712-54X which uses the trident-II ASIC.
HPE rebrands and sells this as the Altoline 6921.
<p>
<h2> 2018 Update</h2>
At introduction in 2016 the list of ported switch software was
<li> Cumulus Linux
<li> Open Network Linux (open source)
<li> OpenSwitch open-source NOS
<li> Switch Light
<p>
The 2018 version of the same data sheet adds:
<li> PicOS
<li> FlexSwitch software from SnapRoute
<p>
This switch was submitted to OCP so there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Accton-5712-5812.pdf">lots of details</a>
