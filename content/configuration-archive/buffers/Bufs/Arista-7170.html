<h2>Arista Tofino switches</h2>
<p>
Introduced in Q2 and Q3 of 2018.
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010612/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7170-Datasheet.pdf">Arista Tofino switches</a> gets very high marks for configurability. Probably, you should decide if your application needs that.
It seems that Arista has done a lot of work to be sure that the amount of rope you need to hang yourself is available.
