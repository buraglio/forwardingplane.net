Intro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010752/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/qfx3500-NW.pdf">press release</a> is dated February 2011. A pretty
cool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010752/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/qfx3500_sales_preso.pdf">sales presentation</a> actually 
contains info on buffer size at slide 25. It has much more information than the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010752/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/qfx3500-datasheet.pdf">published datasheet</a>.
<p>
Juniper switches based on Trident+ and Trident2 have some of the buffers
dedicated to specific ports with the rest held in a shared pool. Juniper
permits allocation rules for shared pool to be adjusted by the user.
Here is an example of what that allocation can look like:

  Total Buffer     :  9360.00 KB

Changing the buffer parameters is a disruptive operation. Queuing and
dequeuing are handled in the forwarding plane based on parameters the
CPU loads into the switch chip. Changing the parameters resets the 
forwarding plane.

Juniper has an <b>excellent</b> white paper on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010752/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ex4600-buffer.pdf">
buffer management</a> that covers several switches that use Trident+ 
and Trident2 silicon.
<p>
This is reinforced by a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010752/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Juniper-buffers.pdf"> Q&A; on a Juniper Mailing</a> list in 2014.
