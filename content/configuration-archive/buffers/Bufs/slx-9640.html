<h2>Extreme Networks 9640</h2>
<p>
Introduced <b>3 Nov 2018</b>
<p>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010709im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/slx9640.PNG" alt="front panel of a 1 RU switch">
<p>
The predecessor of this switch is the SLX 9540 that is approximately
two years older than the 9640. The new switch has a fancy 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010709/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/slx9640-techspecs.pdf">specification sheet</a>. The port counts are different. That
the 9640 has a heart of <b>Qumran</b> is explicit in the specification sheet. That the 9540
ia also a Qumran came from Brocade before Extreme bought the product line.
<p>
There is a problem here. <i>12 100 Gb/s ports</i> exceeds the capability
of a Qumran-MX ASIC. No other manufacturers claim this port count.
