<h2>Cisco Nexus 3048</h2>
<p>
Announced <b>October 18, 2011</b>
<p>
Now seven years old and still on the current product list.
<p>
In a feature chart, Cisco says 
<li> Openflow <b>yes</b>
<li> VXLAN <b>no</b>
<p>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010614/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Cisco-3048.pdf"> data sheet</a> says it has 9 MB of buffer. 
In a paper
<i>Network Requirements for Avid ISIS, Avid
NEXIS, and Interplay PAM and MAM</i> for their software product, Davis Shepard
from Avid said on June 2 2017
<p>
<b>Nexus 3048 ~ N3K-C3048TP-1GE</b>
<ul>
The Nexus 3048 (48x 10/100/1000 with 4 x 10G) is a Trident+ based switch, with 9MB of
buffer (just like the approved F10 S4810). This has been successfully deployed in Hong
Kong for ISIS 7500 (without Avid approval), for a limited number of clients at less than 50%
population for Avid clients. However this .artificially limited. device may have a limited
lifetime as it is based on legacy merchant silicon.
</ul>

While it is a surprise to see a 10 Gb/s ASIC used in a 1 Gb/s application,
there is no reason it shouldn't work.
