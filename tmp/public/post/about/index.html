<p>I&rsquo;m a person of many interests. I hold a bachelors degree in arts and technology (sequence in photography) with a minor in film studies and some of a minor in applied computer science from <a href="http://ilstu.edu/">Illinois State University</a> and am currently a network engineer for the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet).  In previous professional lives, I have been employed by the <a href="http://www.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a> as a Lead Network Engineer, functioned as the Lead Network Engineer for the <a href="http://uc2b.net/2012/09/13/uc2b-awarded-national-association-of-telecommunications-officers-and-advisors-natoa-2012-community-broadband-project-of-the-year/">National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA) broadband project of the year</a>, <a href="http://uc2b.net/">UC2B</a>.  I have worked in the network provider industry for about 15 years, holding Network Engineering positions at Regional Internet Providers as well as at the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a>. I&rsquo;ve participated in <a href="https://scinet.supercomp.org/">SCinet</a> on several occasions and was part of the Network Engineering working group that built and maintained the <a href="https://www.teragrid.org/">TeraGrid</a>. My professional resume can be found <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/resume">here</a>. I also have a google profile available <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101045958892388765754/about">here</a>, but there isn&rsquo;t much there that you won&rsquo;t find here.  Additionally. I have an <a href="http://about.me/buraglio">about.me</a> page that has similar information. On a more personal level, I am married and have two sons, <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/luke/">Luke</a> and <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/zach">Zach</a> as well as 1 dog and 3 cats. I have many hobbies, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zymurgist">zymology</a> (<a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/category/beer/recipe">making beer and mead</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling">grappling</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Jiu_Jitsu">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submission_wrestling">submission wrestling</a>) and as of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2009</sub> hold a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submission_wrestling">Jack McVicker</a>. I am also interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_training">circuit training</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling">Cycling</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding">Skateboarding</a>. I also have interests <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping">camping</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(wilderness)">backpacking</a>, <a href="http://www.budgetbladereview.com/">knives</a> as well as a fascination with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timepiece">timepieces</a> such as watches (both analog and electronic) in addition to electronics in general.</p>

<p>I have acquired a few industry certifications over the years, most of them are from back in the 1990s when I could leverage them for something.  My jobs over the last 12 years have really not seen much value in them, so many are expired and the ones that aren&rsquo;t were taken cold (as in, &ldquo;here is a free exam if you take it now&rdquo;).</p>

<p>To date, the ones I remember are:</p>

<p><strong>LPI (Linux, Beta exam taken free at Comdex, 1998ish?)</strong></p>

<p><strong>MCSE (NT4) (Microsoft 1999)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inet+ (ComTIA, 1999?)</strong></p>

<p><strong>ASE (apple something or other, 1998?)</strong></p>

<p><strong>CCNA (Cisco, 1999-2000?)</strong></p>

<p><strong>CCDA (Cisco, 2000)</strong></p>

<p><strong>CCNP minus BCRAN (Cisco, 2000)</strong></p>

<p><strong>JNCIA JunOS (Juniper, 2011)</strong> <strong>BCNE (Brocade, 2010)</strong> I occasionally hang out on several public and private IRC channes.  My nick is generally buraglio IRC on irc.freenode.net. I hang in the following rooms #packetpushers &amp;  ##pfsense and sometimes others. Thanks to <a href="http://www.networkstatic.net">Brent Salisbury</a> for talking me into blogging again and for not only helping provide inspiration, ideas and content but also for promoting my stuff.  He also provided the nice paragraph above and is a cool dude. I like to participate in community projects, for fun and profit, and have been loosely involved in such projects as pfSense and RANCID (mostly to add or change things I need at the time) but I try to maintain good relationships and help further the projects and the community as a whole. I&rsquo;ve been known to do consulting from time to time as my work and home life permits, it&rsquo;s generally focused on the service provider side but I&rsquo;m usually open to any interesting projects.  Feel free to contact me if I can be of help. I can be best contacted via email, but will usually answer DMs on Twitter and comments on here.  My twitter handle is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/buraglio">@buraglio</a>.  Please excuse my sometimes delayed responses, a family and a usually-more-than-full-time gig makes for a busy life.</p>
