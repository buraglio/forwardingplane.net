<h2>HPE Altoline 6900</h2>
<p>
Based on the earliest date in data sheet, <b>March 2016</b>
<p>
In addition to four SFP+ ports for uplinks, the switch has
20 Gb/s stacking ports presented as QSFP+. Note that software
vendor Cumulus has no use for stacking ports since they are
focused on the data center and top-of-rack switches. Stacking
ports are useful when the task is to build a large array of
ports for an access arrangement in a cable closet. That is
not Cumulus' market.
<p>
There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010756/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/HPE-Altoline-6900.pdf">data sheet.</a>
<p>
The Altoline 6900 has a switch element integrated with a dual
core ARM processor. We're guessing: higher integration yields
lower manufacturing cost. It also saves on power.
