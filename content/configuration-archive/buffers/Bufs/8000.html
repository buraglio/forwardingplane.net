<h2>Cisco 8000 routers</h2>
<p>
Sigh. No ordering guide means no orderable products. Still, part descriptions
exist. Here, as place holders for promises not yet kept are the 1-RU 8201 and
the 2-RU 8202. There is a thing that calls itself a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010651/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/datasheet-8000-sys.pdf">
data sheet</a>. But, it is not really a data sheet. Information like actual buffer
sizing is not yet available. But when it becomes available, I'm sure it will be good.
(24 June 2020)
<p>
<h2>Update April 2021</h2>
The routers have made it to the price list, so they are orderable. While
I don't usually list prices, the 8201 and 8202 have take-your-breath-away
lists at about $225K. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010651/http://itprice.com/"> itprice.com</a>.
The Q100 parts now have big brother Q200 counterparts.
<p>
<h2>8201-32FH</h2>
<p>

datasheet</a> that also represents the Q100 parts carries Sept 2021 date. Q200
parts with HBM memory have 8 GB. HBM memory size of the Q100 parts is not
specified.
