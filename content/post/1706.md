title: 'ElastiFlow Base VM'

Included here is a vanilla Ubuntu 18 LTS VM with a basic [Elastiflow](https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow) install. This includes all of the components of an ElasticStack plus the front end pieces of the ElastiFlow project. Most of the install is based on [this](https://www.catapultsystems.com/blogs/install-elastiflow-on-ubuntu-18-04-part-1/) how-to. 

Included in the image is also a base install of NGINX and certbot so that you can reverse proxy the access and have a valid SSL certificate. 

This was build and validated on Proxmox 6.0.6 but should be able to run on VMWare as well with a bit of qemu-img conversion. As expected, ElastiFlow (and ElasticStack) is fairly resource hungry, 16G of Memory and a handful of CPU cores is the bare minimum to run this with any real efficiency. Ubuntu 18 has changed how the networking is setup - it is all located in /etc/netplan/ now.
