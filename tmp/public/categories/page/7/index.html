        A bit of back history: I came from BSD land. I was a FreeBSD user from way back in the 1990s. BSD land is a land of secure boxes and very high uptimes. It&#8217;s also a land of arguably clunky package support, a lot of compiling by hand and these days, not nearly as encompassing package and network tuning support. I decided to move to Linux&rdquo;) a while ago, reluctantly, and chose Debian as my flavor of choice.

        Recently we encountered a very strange behavior on an SRX 5800 cluster. The cluster, which is in active/active mode, started dropping OSPF adjacencies to it&#8217;s neighboring routing equipment, in this case, Juniper MX480 and Brocade/Foundry MLX8. Strange behavior indeed, since for us, these had been rock solid for around 2 years and we&#8217;d never seen this odd behavior before.
Honestly, we started looking at the routers first since this was something the SRX has never done before.

        It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a fan of the model Arista Networks is using to make gear and provide innovative services and products. In my opinion, they&#8217;re changing the landscape of campus and data center networking gear. I&#8217;m always a fan of the little guy trying to change the world and this falls under that category. For those that don&#8217;t know, Arista Networks is a &#8220;hardware&#8221; networking company that is using merchant silicon wrapped in their custom linux based operating system (which is very much like IOS).

        Recently SI6 released the IPv6 Toolkit 1.3  This release is on the heels of this IETF draft  on IPv6 host scanning. It was long thought that scanning an IPv6 network was impossible. The address space was too large and reliably ascertaining the hosts from it would be too time consuming to even attempt. However, as Dr. Hans Zarkov says in the 1980 classic cult film of my youth, Flash Gordon, &#8220;You can&#8217;t beat the human spirit!

        I am a network engineer by profession, but with the proliferation of SDN and OpenFlow, I have had to spend a lot of time re-learning a lot of system admin skills that I&#8217;d shelved years ago. Now, I&#8217;ve been a virtualization user forever. From VMware (Fusion, ESX), VirtualBox, to Parallels, I&#8217;ve used them at least in testing if not in production environments. I&#8217;d not really spent any mentionable amount of time with XEN, qEMU or KVM, but some projects I was working on suggested it for the virtualization mechanism, so I figured I&#8217;d try to pick it up.

        I&#8217;ve recently run into a situation where there was no longer enough space in the FIB to handle both the full IPv4 global table and the full IPv6 global table. We prefer to run a default-free network within this particular SP network, but in this case, until a hardware refresh can happen, we&#8217;ll need to adjust that. Given what we knew about the size of both tables, it made more sense to take a default IPv6 route from one transit provider and filter the rest.

        Last year, Networking Field Day was something that I&#8217;d heard of but wasn&#8217;t really aware of what is really was. I occasionally looked at Twitter and saw the hash tags but did not know much about how it was set up or what it was about. In fact, I actually thought it was supposed to be like the HAM radio field day stuff where you go out and build out an emergency network on the fly.

        I started working on Juniper equipment around 2002. At my employer, we had an M40 with the serial number 256. We did Layer3 only. I had no idea if the Juniper even did layer2. It certainly wasn&#8217;t a layer3 switch like a 6500 like I was used to. It was like a deliciously robust version of any Layer 3 router I&#8217;d worked on previously. Over the years Juniper has added a switching line utilizing their FreeBSD based OS, JunOS.

        OK, maybe they&#8217;re not totally dead, but they&#8217;re being demoted. To the mail room.
During the course of my career I&#8217;ve always had at least some responsibility for firewall and security devices. In those ~15 years, how these boxes are built and function has shifted. From the perspective of my career, there were IOS ACLs (yes, I know, not a firewall), there was the IOS firewall versions and there were software packages such as gauntlet, checkpoint.

        This week there was a lot of buzz about SDN (as usual). There was alightreading thread that I commented on and a fantastic read by Brent Salisbury about being the steamroller and not the road that got me thinking about OpenFlow and SDN in a way I had not before.


All that is old is new again. I remember when internal networks were small and routing protocols were taboo in many internal environments.
