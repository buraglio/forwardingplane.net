I had the need to build a FlowVisor instance under CentOS.  Since nearly all of the docs I could find were for debian, I threw this together.  I utilized this [GENI doc](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/FlowVisor) and the [github docs](https://github.com/OPENNETWORKINGLAB/flowvisor/wiki/Installation-from-Source) as a simple reference.  This is the quick and dirty method I used: Install the prerequisites:```
sudo yum -y install ant eclipse java-1.6.0-openjdk.x86\_64 git
sudo yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
```Create my standard directories:```
mkdir /services
cd /services
git clone git://github.com/OPENNETWORKINGLAB/flowvisor.git
```Navigate, add user and install```
cd flowvisor
adduser flowvisor
sudo make fvuser=flowvisor fvgroup=flowvisor install
```Here is the relativde output I saw:```
\[root@collector flowvisor\]# sudo make fvuser=flowvisor fvgroup=flowvisor install
ant
Buildfile: build.xml

init:
\[mkdir\] Created dir: /services/flowvisor/build

This yields a "working" flow visor.

Lock it down with a password:
``````
yum -y install pwgen
test -f /etc/flowvisor.passwd || sudo sh -c 'pwgen -sB 24 > /etc/flowvisor.passwd'
service flowvisor restart
```
