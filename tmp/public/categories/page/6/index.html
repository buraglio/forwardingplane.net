        Securing SSH is a form or art. It&#8217;s often debated, much like blocking all ICMP packets (which I normally disagree with). If you need good proof, read these posts by Bob Plankers. There is a camp that likes to promote moving to a non-standard port. There is a faction that likes to block it completely except from a handful of hosts. Then there are those that like to leave it open all together.

        I have a love-hate feeling about &#8220;predictions&#8221; about the upcoming year, especially tech predictions. I don&#8217;t like media sensationalism of any kind, and a lot of the tech predctions are just that, sensational, extreme talk to draw in readers or viewers. I&#8217;m choosing to go down a more subtle path, these are things I&#8217;ve thought about lately but will likely forget in the upcoming year, unless they actually happen, in which case I&#8217;d likely do an &#8220;ah, I remember thinking that may happen&#8221; gesture.

        I am very happy and flattered that this site actually proves to be useful to folks. It was always my intention to use this as a platform to try to give back a bit, to help with any data I may have run across that was interesting, useful, or obscure. I utilize sites like etherialmind.com, packetpushers.net, evilrouters.net, networkstatic.net and ioshints more than I can even measure. I wanted to try to contribute as much as I could to pay it back.

        After reading Stephen Fosketts post &#8220;How Will Cisco Recover From The Consumer Strategy Blunder?&#8220;, it got me thinking. It&#8217;s a very different world than when Cisco got started all those years ago. I don&#8217;t have any brand loyalty to Cisco, I learned on cisco gear 14-15 years ago for the most part, but I try to keep the mentality of &#8220;the right tool for the job&#8221;, which means constantly surveying th emarket for new and interesting ways to do things.

        It&#8217;s always annoying to me, being a convert from *BSD to Linux, that tools lke dig and host aren&#8217;t in the minimal base install. I realise that this makes me somewhat of a hypocrite, as I prefer an additive system rather than a subtractive base OS. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m continually surprised that &#8220;host&#8221; isn&#8217;t available after installing a minimal CentOS system without adding an additional package. So, since I always forget, here is a quick blog post to remind me and any other converts how to install those tools:

        I have a bunch of Apple wireless gear at my house. It&#8217;s inexpensive, feature rich and easy to maintain. However, with the update to mountain lion a while ago, the ability to install the older Airport Utility stopped. This is annoying since I have what apple now considers &#8220;advanced&#8221; features like IPv6 at my home and essentially all my gear here is a lab (except for the plex server =)

        I&#8217;ve been lamenting about the SDN WAN options for a while now. Having SDN/OpenFlow in a data center or campus is relatively well documented and already widely deployed. Google has been doing SDN across their private WAN in production. These pieces are easy. What isn&#8217;t easy is the ability to plumb SDN across many domains that are under disparate control. This part is hard. What is lacking is a fundamental framework, or set of primitives to build from.

        There has been a lot of buzz about the service provider model, net neutrality and tiered access for consumers in the past few years. Just this week Google has been accused of paying OrangeÂ (more likely Orange is forcing google) for handling its traffic. This is a VERY slippery slope that teeters on the edge of what we all want to avoid as consumers or content creators.
This recent story has sparked something I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a very long time.

        If you are running a network and aren&#8217;t using RANCID, you should give it a serious look. RANCID is a cross platform configuration management toolkit for backing up router configurations and certain environmental and hardware information into version control. It&#8217;s been around for as long as I can remember and supports nearly every platform I can think of, including a few modules that I cobbled together myself. There is are a few nice web based front ends for CVS and SVN, I prefer to use ViewVC because I have a lot of experience with it, however, there may be cases where a web server isn&#8217;t a good option, unavailable or just too much work.

        Starting from a base CentOS system with nothing configured, and referencing the CentOS wiki, here is how I like to set up a headless virtualbox environment:
Disable selinux. It&#8217;s overly cumbersome and is enabled by default in CentOS. I like to permanently disable it even though the default is permissive. I ride the edge, I know.
vi /etc/selinux/config  and change  SELINUX=enabled  to  SELINUX=disabled  Then reboot.  Using the methodology I originally found found here, I like to install the epel repo using this method:
