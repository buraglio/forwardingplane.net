Juniper has Trident II switches in three configurations. The -24Q has expansion slots that take the switch to 32 QSFP ports. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010626/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/juniper-5100.pdf">data sheet</a> (Nov 2013) says that dedicated port buffers take 25 percent of the capacity, so the dynamic pool
would reckon to 9 Mbytes.

Juniper put together an long white paper on 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010626/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ex4600-buffer.pdf">buffer management</a> 
that covers several switches that use Trident+ and Trident2 silicon.
