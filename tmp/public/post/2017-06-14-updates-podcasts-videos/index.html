    <div class="content"> <p>Anyone that looks at this site with any regularity may have noticed that I have been pretty remiss in adding posts &#8211; for that I apologize, things have been busy. However, I have not been absent in the tech world&#8230;quite the opposite, in fact. I&#8217;ve been spending more and more time on podcasts and other forms of tech media which I have not provided links for here. So, to help expose that, here are a few of the other media resources I&#8217;ve been popping up in. Professionally I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of my time testing things like <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/srr1/">segment routing</a>, software routing stacks for <a href="https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/2_White_The_State_Of_Open_Source_Routers.pdf">disaggregated routing</a>, DDoS detection and DDoS mitigation.</p>

<p>In the free time I would typically spend in my home lab, I&#8217;ve become enamored with Wireless ISPs and how they work. I&#8217;d done some WISP work off and on over the years but it was primarily focused on L3 &#8211; I&#8217;ve gone deeper and started learning about more RF strategy and detail as well as delved pretty deeply into a fair amount of the gear details. There is some <em>crazy</em> good, innovative stuff going on in this space and it happily hums along well outside of the hype engines that are the juggernauts of hyperscale data center and enterprise networking. I find it a refreshing change from the marketing machine of the mainstream networking industry, representing more of what the real world of being a smaller service provider is like (which is where I got started, so there is an amount of nostalgic comfort there), and there are folks out there are serious use cases for things like SR and <a href="https://rule11.tech/?s=disaggregated">disaggregated routing</a> just waiting to be tested.<br />

<p>In addition, I&#8217;ve been involved in a few projects regarding security and DDoS detection and mitigation (CoreFlow) that have been pretty interesting, one of which which <a href="https://tnc17.geant.org/core/presentation/30">I recently presented on at TNC 17 in Linz, Austria</a>. Slides can be found <a href="https://tnc17.geant.org/getfile/3728">here</a>. More information can be found on the project CoreFlow in the published paper <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=fr&amp;user=alONArcAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=alONArcAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC">here</a>. I&#8217;ll probably talk more about this project focused on ISP DDoS detection and mitigation as the code matures, but feel free to contact me with questions/comments.</p>
