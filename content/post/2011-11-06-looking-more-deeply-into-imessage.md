<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I've been looking at iMessage from time to time as my schedule permits, for some reason that I can't really explain I'm fixated on it.  So, just like I did with FaceTime, I started doing network sniffing to see just what it's doing.  The results were not terribly unexpected.  </span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">   iPhone.buraglio.com.53140 > st11p01st-courier143-bz.push.apple.com.5223: Flags [R], cksum 0x5ec8 (correct), seq 4109691913, win 0, length 0</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">14:07:51.665485 IP (tos 0x20, ttl 49, id 11699, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 64, bad cksum 0 (->8fc7)!)</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">    st11p01st-courier143-bz.push.apple.com.5223 > iPhone.buraglio.com.53140: Flags [.], cksum 0xb792 (correct), seq 76, ack 475, win 192, options [nop,nop,TS val 154465503 ecr 230925781,nop,nop,sack 1 {474:475}], length 0</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">14:07:51.667170 IP (tos 0x20, ttl 64, id 22535, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 40)</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">    iPhone.buraglio.com.53140 > st11p01st-courier143-bz.push.apple.com.5223: Flags [R], cksum 0x5ec8 (correct), seq 4109691913, win 0, length 0</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">14:07:51.677715 IP (tos 0x20, ttl 46, id 41627, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 52, bad cksum 0 (->f541)!)</span><br /><div><br />However, it appears to me, in my initial looking, that the outgoing message is inconsistently using the cellular data network.  I can replicate this by sending a message via my iPhone to another iMessage user, and I never see any traffic from that host on my network.  However, if I get a response, it comes back in similar to the capture above.  It would make sense to me that the service would use wifi when available as opposed to the more expensive cellular data.<br /><br />If I have my iPad on, I see that traffic as well as it only has wifi. <br /><br /><br />  <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">  iPhone.buraglio.com.52084 > st11p01st-courier094-bz.push.apple.com.5223: Flags [.], cksum 0x7f0b (correct), seq 160, ack 2436, win 8122, options [nop,nop,TS val 121427102 ecr 1305430889], length 0</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">    st11p01st-courier066-bz.push.apple.com.5223 > iPad.buraglio.com.57869: Flags [P.], cksum 0xbd1c (correct), seq 1327:2436, ack 160, win 501, options [nop,nop,TS val 3197914588 ecr 1393723712], length 1109</span><br /><div><br /><br />So, nothing terribly conclusive so far in my small amount of testing, more data capture and variables to come.  </div><div><br /></div></div><div>[[ This is a content summary only.
