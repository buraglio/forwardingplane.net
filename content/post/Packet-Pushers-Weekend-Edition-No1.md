We all know the [Packet Pushers](https://www.packetpushers.net). Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting in on the inagural ["Packet Pushers Weekend Edition"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQ9ppGwrEo&t=1668s) - an informal, video round table where we discuss fun and relevant topics in the space of networking and other related IT topics. Much discussion was had on SR-MPLS, Service providers, SD-WAN, and Cloud. I hope to participate again, as I found the experience both entertaining and informative, I hope you will too.

Tune in here:
