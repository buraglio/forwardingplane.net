<h2>Edge-core AS7312-54X -and- AS7312-54XS</h2>
<p>
Announced at OCP in March 2017. The blurb from the press release says:
<p>
<i>To meet the need for optimized 25 GbE top-of-rack switching, Edgecore is 
contributing the specification and design package for the AS7300-54X open 
network switch, based on the Broadcom StrataXGS Tomahawk Switch Series, 
providing 48 x SFP28 ports each capable of 10 GbE or 25 GbE, plus 
6 x QSFP28 100 GbE uplink ports.</i>
<p>
The Edge-core web site is way behind announced products. It does not 
acknowledge any 25 Gb/s products. A data sheet marked DRAFT carries
a date of November 2016 on a CZ web site. 
A more recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010730/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS7312-54XS_DS_R01_20171108.pdf">datasheet</a>
is dated November 2017. The first DRAFT datasheet says 16 MB packet
buffer while a year later it is now 22 MB. So,<b> Tomahawk+</b>

</ul>
<p>
Edgecore submitted this design to OCP in a 2017 filing. The switch
part number is in the diagram. In the OCP filing, the p/n is AS7300-54X.
Now that the datasheet is out, it is AS7312-54X.
