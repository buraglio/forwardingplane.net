Allied Telesis responded to my question: "Do you have a switch based on
Broadcom merchant silicon?" Answer: Yes. DC2552XS.
<p>
The data sheet shows 9 Mbytes of packet buffer memory -- hallmark of the 
Broadcom Trident+. The data sheet and the Users Manual are silent on how
the buffer is allocated. I asked. The answer is in email from Josh Shalack, Allied
Telesis Systems Engineer on August 21, 2013:
<p>
<i>The initial buffer allocation currently has about 20% of the total buffer 
being shared out across the 64 by 10Gig ports, with the rest then being 
dynamically allocated to ports where queues fill up. At the moment there 
is no user control of these settings. At this stage there are no plans 
for larger buffers on our 10G switches. . . .</i>
<p>

Of course, since the buffers are in the switch silicon, the buffers are
what they are.
<p>
This is a layer 2 switch with IPv4 management protocols. Packet MTU is
12,288 bytes and cannot be changed. There is no 
routing and no IPv6 in the data sheet or the manual.  LLDP (link layer
discovery protocol) is also not part of the feature set. It has the ability
to honor flow control pause frames, but does not <i>send</i> pause frames.
No buffers are needed to give senders a window to pause since the request 
will never be made. Some Trident+ derivative switches have an FCoE feature
set with Priority Flow Control. Allied Telesis does not.
With that for a flow control feature set, 7 Mbytes in the dynamic buffer pool
paints a consistent picture. 
<p>
To be clear, flow control and QoS are not desirable features in a switch
dropped into a Big Data transfer pathway. At our peril, we are looking at
feature sets as guide posts to unstated internal design decisions.
