If anyone is interested in the talks I participated in at Joint Techs in Fairbanks, AK, they are now on the internet2 sites.  <br /><br /><a href="http://events.internet2.edu/2011/jt-uaf/agenda.cfm?go=session&id=10001852&event=1151">IPv6 feature support</a><br /><br /><a href="http://events.internet2.edu/2011/jt-uaf/agenda.cfm?go=session&id=10001863&event=1151">IPv6 campus panel discussion</a><br /><br />They're apparently not embeddable, but can be watched from the Joint Techs site.<div>[[ This is a content summary only.
