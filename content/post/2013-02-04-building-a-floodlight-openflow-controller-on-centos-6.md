A bit of back history: I came from BSD land. I was a FreeBSD user from way back in the 1990s. BSD land is a land of secure boxes and very high uptimes. It's also a land of arguably clunky package support, a lot of compiling by hand and these days, not nearly as encompassing package and network tuning support. <a title="Better support for Linux (and annoyed about it)" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/06/better-support-for-linux-and-annoyed-about-it/">I decided to move to Linux</a> a while ago, reluctantly, and chose Debian as my flavor of choice. I do love debian, however, I very quiuckly realized that even debian is a bit of a fringe OS build of Linux. Commercial support is nearly all based on RHEL. Folks that run RHEL also run CentOS. We run both in my day job. About a year ago to I, once again, decided I needed to learn CentOS.
There are a lot of posts about building floodlight as an openflow controller. I used this tutorial <a href="http://networkstatic.net/floodlight-openflow-controller-gui-applet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Salisbury did</a> to build mine. There is a good one on the <a href="http://floodlight.openflowhub.org/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openflow hub</a> site as well. I've found that many are based on Debian or Ubuntu, which can be subtly different than a CentOS / RHEL experience.
&nbsp;
In CentOS, log in and sudo -s or su to root. Install the prereqs:
<em>yum -y install build-essential default-jdk ant python-dev eclipse git</em>
<em>mkdir /services/floodlight</em>
<em>cd /services/floodlight/</em>
<em>git clone git://github.com/floodlight/floodlight.git
ant</em>
Start floodlight in the background.
<em>./floodlight.sh &amp;</em>
Because I'm terrible at looking at directions, I went to the base URL. This will yield an error that looks something like this:
<em>{"name":"Not Found","error":true,"throwable":null,"description":"The server has not found anything matching the request URI","success":false,"informational":false,"code":404,"reasonPhrase":"Not Found","uri":"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5","serverError":false,"connectorError":false,"clientError":true,"globalError":false,"redirection":false,"recoverableError":false}</em>
The right way to access floodlight is to use the entire URL:
http://&lt;address&gt;:8080/ui/index.html
Learn from my stupidity.

Here is a script to build it for you:
<pre>#!/bin/bash
echo "Installing prerequisits:"
yum -y install build-essential default-jdk ant python-dev eclipse git
echo "Installing floodlight to /services/floodight/"
mkdir /services/floodlight
cd /services/floodlight/
git clone git://github.com/floodlight/floodlight.git
ant
echo "Starting floodlight:"
./floodlight.sh&amp;
echo "Floodlight started, point your beowser at http://&lt;address&gt;:8080/ui/index.html"</pre>
