      <description>I recently had the opportinity to work with the much-anticipated Brocade VDX &amp;ldquo;Ethernet Fabric&amp;rdquo; platform. I do admit tha tI&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by this product. I&amp;rsquo;d seen it work multiple times in demos and it worked so well and looked to easy that we actively tried to throw curve balls at the demo organizer to prove it wasn&amp;rsquo;t canned. It succeeded. The hardware hashing across the VLAGs is very slick. The VMware VSwitch integration worked well and was handy.</description>
