<h2> Cisco NCS5001 NCS5002 NCS5011</h2>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010655im_/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/NCS5K.jpg"> 
<p>
Cisco laid out their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010655/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/NCS-hardware.pdf">  merchant hardware</a> in a CiscoLive! talk in July 2016.  
The <b>trident2+</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010655/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cisco-ncs5001-datasheet.pdf">5001 and 5002</a> 
were introduced in November 2015. The <i>Setup and Installation Guide</i> was first published
in December 2015.  The <b>Tomahawk</b>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010655/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cisco-ncs5011-datasheet.pdf"> NCS 5011</a>
seems to have surfaced in March 2016. Cisco positions these guys as aggregation devices.
<p>
The 5001 and 5002 don't seem other Broadcom Trident2 products because they use the 2+ version of
the switch chip along with a gearbox for the 100 Gb/s ports. 
Packet buffer for the 5001 and 5002 are listed on the data sheet.
