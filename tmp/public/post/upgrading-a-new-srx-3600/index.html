    <h1 class="title"> Upgrading a new SRX 3600 </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>We are putting a few new SRX 3600 clusters into production soon, and we&rsquo;ve had them for about 6 months in boxes. This presented a fairly significant issue, one that I didn&rsquo;t think about until it smacked me in the face.<br />

<p><strong>Wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>the code that shipped on these boxes was so old, and we waited so long to upgrade them that I was unable to upgrade them straight to anything modern. To compound the issue, the upgrade was only able to be performed from certain code level releases as noted <a href="http://forums.juniper.net/t5/SRX-Services-Gateway/SRX-3400-upgrade-failure/m-p/55416">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a problem. I logged into the Juniper site to get the appropriate code, low and behold, it&rsquo;s not available. I had to contact jtac and convince them that the code wasn&rsquo;t there (which was a bit frustrating). Once they understood the issue (which took a bit longer than I expected; I don&rsquo;t have Agility services on these particular boxes or I would never have had the jtac &ldquo;issue&rdquo;), they provided me with a download link for junos-srx3000-9.6R4.4-domestic. Once I had that code I was able to upgrade to it and then to 10.4.</p>

<p>Not a huge issue, but something that was very annoying to have to jump through since I&rsquo;ve never seen this issue upgrading a Juniper device.</p>
