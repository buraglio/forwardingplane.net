There has been some recent chatter on the [IPv6 Ops mailing list](http://lists.cluenet.de/mailman/listinfo/ipv6-ops) about the feature matrix. Sadly, I've let this sort of wither on the vine for a while in favor of OpenFlow and SDN.  At the end of the day, though, as a whole we actually **need** IPv6 more than SDN and OpenFlow at this moment in time, so I'm resurrecting it.  It is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRPccDFxV1kdEVNNEhFbG9UZWJlNVJ4NHJlWGtWV1E&usp=sharing).
A few additions have been made and there is now a "last edited" cell so folks can tell if the data is stale or not.  What we need now is your input.  Do you have experience with something that isn't on here?  Send over some details.  We'll get it added.  Don't be shy.  This is important.
