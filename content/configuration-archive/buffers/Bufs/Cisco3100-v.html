Announced April 2016.
<p>
The Nexus 3100-v <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cisco-3100v.pdf">family of switches</a> are based on the Trident2+. 
The ASIC has more buffer memory than
its predecessor Trident2 and is built with 28 nM technology instead of 40 nM. 
There may be some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/trident2+.PNG"> method to Cisco's part number</a> system.
<p>
The theme here is <i>Things you can do with 128 SERDES running at 10 Gb/s</i>. 
It is amusing that Broadcom counts 128 10-Gb/s SERDES as a total switch
bandwidth of 1.28 Tb/s. Cisco looks at the same switch and counts <i>in</i>
and <i>out</i> separately and gets 2.56 Tb/s. Broadcom makes a companion
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/gearbox.pdf">gearbox</a> chip
that can convert between 10 Gb/s and 25 Gb/s lanes. Using up to four of
the dual-port gearboxes, the TridentII+ can host up to eight QSFP28 100 G ports.
<p>
Models with SFP+ [31108PC-V] and 10G-base-T [31108TC-V] are available.
The SERDES can run at port speeds of 100 Mb/s, 1 Gb/s and native 10 Gb/s
on the distribution ports..
