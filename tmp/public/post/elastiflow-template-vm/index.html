    <h1 class="title"> ElastiFlow Template VM </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Flow data is a critical piece of understanding how your network works what what it is actively doing. It also provides a great baseline and capacity planning tool. However, some of the more feature rich NetFlow and/or sFlow collectors can be quite daunting in their cost and/or complexity to install. <a href="https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow">ElastiFlow</a> is a great alternative for flow analytics and is built on the well traveled and robust <a href="https://www.elastic.co/start?ultron=[EL]-[B]-[AMER]-US+CA-Exact&amp;blade=adwords-s&amp;Device=c&amp;thor=elastic%20stack&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuKC5xefB5AIVCYnICh0wEg5lEAAYASAAEgIp_fD_BwE">ElasticStack</a>, meaning, its back end is well documented, well supported, and scales exceptionally well. For those that would like to play around with this but don&rsquo;t want to take the time to install it (see below for the instruction set I used), I have provided a simple VM to toy around with.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-07-at-11.00.35-PM-1024x704.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Included here is a vanilla Ubuntu 18 LTS VM with a basic <a href="https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow">Elastiflow</a> install. This includes all of the components of an ElasticStack plus the front end pieces of the ElastiFlow project. Most of the install is based on <a href="https://www.catapultsystems.com/blogs/install-elastiflow-on-ubuntu-18-04-part-1/">this</a> how-to. </p>

<p>Included in the image is also a base install of NGINX and certbot so that you can reverse proxy the access and have a valid SSL certificate. There are a plethora of guides on how to accomplish that task on the internet.</p>

<p>This was build and validated on Proxmox 6.0.6 but should be able to run on VMWare as well with a bit of qemu-img conversion. As expected, ElastiFlow (and ElasticStack) are fairly resource hungry. 16G of Memory and a handful of CPU cores is the bare minimum to run this with any real efficiency. Additionally, Ubuntu 18 has changed how the networking is setup - it is all located in /etc/netplan/ now.   </p>
