<h2>Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller</h2>
<p>
Two hardware devices <b>9800-80</b> and <b>9800-40</b> function as Wi-Fi AP controllers. 
These are not Ethernet switches. They are, however, based on UADP ASICs. The software
can also run on some Catalyst switches for small installations. 
<p>
The C9800 runs on Cisco's IOS-XE software while its predecessor runs on AirOS. The former
should provide reliability advantages over the latter.
