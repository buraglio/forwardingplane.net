Brocade introduced this switch in September 2013. It has <i>speed and feeds</i>
that are reminiscent of the Broadcom Trident+ family of products, but this is 
not yet-another Trident clone. It is a single chip monolithic switch with
24 MBytes of integrated packet buffer memory. I suspect the reason Brocade
may have cooked up a custom chip rather than using <i>merchant silicon</i>
is because the VDX family sports TRILL for its data center fabric. TRILL
is not part of the commonly available feature set in merchant silicon.
<p>
The switch is available in 48-port SFP+ and 48-port twisted pair Ethernet variants. Brocade has a version that license-locks the port speeds to 1 Gb/s until
you send them more money. They call this <i>pay as you grow</i>. For both
models, the uplink ports are QSFP 40 Gb/s.

Nick Lippis, one of the for-hire switch testers, had the 6740 run through
its paces. Registered users can get a copy of the report in PDF format, but
you can listen to exactly the same content either on youtube or in 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010611/http://lippisreport.com/2014/04/brocades-new-vdx-6740-performance-test-result-record/"> podcast format</a>.
The report shows a switch that is line-rate on all ports at all packet sizes 
but does not measure capability to absorb microbursts except to mention
the total amount of packet buffer without saying anytbing about how it is
used. Fortunately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010611/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/email-6740"> email from TAC</a> says more than
Lippis' 33 page report.
