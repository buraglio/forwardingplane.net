FS doesn't have a clean data sheet for this switch. It does have
a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010556/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/N8560.pdf"> table of specifications.</a> There is also a
configuration guide which is 28 MB and 2600 pages so it is hard to
recommend it to the gentle reader. But for those with grit and
determination it is available at this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010556/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/n5860-and-n8560-and-nc8200-series-switches-configuration-guide.pdf">
link</a>.
<p>
FS sells a handful of Broadcom ASIC based switches under its own name.
Some have ONIE as an option. This switch does not.  Some others have CumulusLinux as an option.
This switch is not in the Cumulus hardware list -- but some other FS switches are.
It appears that Broadcom's CLI clone of Cisco's IOS is an option. Broadcom's name is
<b>iCOS</b>.
