 slide deck</a> from a June 2018
talk at CiscoLive! in Orlando explains the role of merchant silicon in the Nexus product line. There are 
Nexus 3132 variants based on Trident-2, Trident-2+ and now Trident-3. There is also a product
that contains the Tofino switch ASIC. Thanks to  Timothy Prickett Morgan for writing an article reviewing the slide deck.
