This number -- 14 Mbytes -- comes from the Miercom report. Miercom limited their testing to
packet sizes below 1500. They did not test jumbo frames. Their results seem to indicate that
buffer size is limited by packet count, so a better showing might be expected for 9000 byte
frames.
<p>
All the switches that Miercom has tested use a buffer particle architecture that chains
together fixed length chunks to store large frames. Give or take one buffer particle --
typically 300 bytes -- only the amount of memory needed is used for each packet.  If Miercom 
results are to be believed,
none of the manufacturers tested (Broadcom, HP, Cisco, Arista) can successfully use chained
buffers to hold packets without wasting memory. Either that, or there is something wrong with the design of
Mierom's tests. 
<p>
Miercom competes with Tolly in the <i>for-hire</i> testing business. Tolly's tests that include
microburst capability come to generally a different result.  See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010605/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/IBM_G8264">
IBM 8264</a> review for references.
<p>
Other tests performed by the <i>for-hire</i> community follow test plans laid out in
standards RFCs. But there is no guidance on how testers should measure microburst
