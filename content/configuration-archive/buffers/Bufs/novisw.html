It appears that NoviSwitch's primary product is software. 
Switches are a side line. Their primary product is software
to implement OF-ODA agents on switches. And that work has
transitioned to providing P4 agents.  
In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010755/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QURBrluxhMg&amp;t=223s">
 presentation at Open Network Connect 2019</a> Jesper Eriksson
detailed why P4 will get all their development effort going forward. Work
on OF-DPA has stopped and no new features are planned.
All switch models are available with TCAM
internal to the NP-5 ASIC and optionally with external TCAM for more 
wildcard matches.

<b>Buffering</b>
<p>
Curiously, the data sheets do not specify the amount of packet memory.
A separate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010755/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/NoviFlow-FlowShaper.pdf">QoS data sheet</a>
appears to apply to all NP-5 switches. It seems to say that there is 
1 GByte of packet memory.
