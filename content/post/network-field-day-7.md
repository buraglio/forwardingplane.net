A while ago I got an email asking me to participate in [Network Field Day 7](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/).  I was very happy and humbled to get asked again since I wasn't able to attend [NFD5](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/) or [NFD6](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/) for various reasons outside of my control (although I did try to [participate with NFD5  remotely](http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/network-field-day-5/ "Network Field Day 5 – Participate Remotely")).   If you're unfamiliar with the [tech field day](http://techfieldday.com/) series, you should spend a little time and learn about the value it brings.  There are archived video feeds of [previous conferences](http://techfieldday.com/timing/past/) and [live feed](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/) and social media outlets for current field days. To be included in such an event is an amazing experience in and of itself, but to be included with a technical group like this is pretty humbling.  This NFD includes the likes of [Bob McCouch](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//bob-mccouch/), [Brandon Carroll](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/brandon-carroll/), [Chris Marget](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/chris-marget/), [Edward Henry](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//edward-henry/), [Ethan Banks](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//ethan-banks/), [Greg Ferro](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/rich-brambley/chris-evans/greg-ferro/), [John Herbert](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//john-herbert/),[Josh O'Brien](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/josh-obrien/), [Matt Oswalt](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/matt-oswalt/), [Paul Stewart](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//paul-stewart/), and [Teren Bryson](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/teren-bryson/).  All very competent and forward thinking folks in the networking and IT fields.  If this isn't enough to get you interested in the value of this event, let me tell you about the schedule.
