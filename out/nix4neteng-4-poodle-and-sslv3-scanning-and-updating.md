With the recent release of the [POODLE SSLv3 vulnerability](https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf), folks are scrambling around trying to figure out what runs what and where.  Running a handful of things that do SSL, I was obligated, both personally and professionally, to figure out an easy way to drill down and figure out what does what and then fix the vulnerable services.  When there are a lot of devices, this can seem like a daunting task, and it is if you're trying to do it manually.  This is where [NMAP](http://nmap.org/) comes into play.  NMAP is an extremely powerful tool for scanning and enumerating your own network, not just a tool for the script kiddies to port scan. Since there is no SSL patch at the time of this writing, and since SSLv3 is old and depricated, it is a good idea to see what services support it and then squish them in favor of TLS 1+.  Thankfully, smarter folks than myself have done most of the legwork for accomplishing this task and written most of it down [here](http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-enum-ciphers.html). NMAP has a wealth of cool scripts and bolt ons that extend it in amazing ways.  To accomplish our tasks we'll ned to do a few things. Install nmap. I ran into issues with the [nselibs](http://nmap.org/book/nse-library.html) being incomplete, so I grabbed the source and built it that way as opposed to using yum.```
git clone git@github.com:nmap/nmap.git
```We then need to build it from source which requires the dev tools:```
sudo yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'
cd nmap
./configure
sudo make
```and alternatively```
sudo make install
```I like to just run it from my directory since there are path considerations.```
(~/nmap) v-chimera $ ./nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 10.14.14.0/27

```From here we can see that there is a host that needs to be updated. There are a wealth of docs out there for changing out the supported version. Most of my stuff is apache so I used [this guide](https://zmap.io/sslv3/). For embedded devices, the best option is to filter access \[which you should probably be doing anyway\] until there is a patched firmware version.
