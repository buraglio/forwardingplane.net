This switch is listed in the CumulusNetworks compatibilty guide. It has
an extensive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010749/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/lp1163.pdf">datasheet.</a> This datasheet, however,
does not include description of the ASIC or its packet buffer memory.  Note that management ports
and interfaces are on the front of the switch -- distinguishing it from
other designs that put management on the rear panel.
