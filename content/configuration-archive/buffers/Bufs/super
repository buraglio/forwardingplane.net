Supermicro, popular computer manufacturer, also sells network switches. As noted by the dual entries in
the Trident+ table, they have both a 10 Gb/s Tw-pair model and an SFP+ model. The switches have been 
reviewed in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010618/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Supermicro&#32;SSE.pdf">article</a> by Chris Ramseyer posted at TweakTown.com.
<p>
Each of the switch varients is available with choice of air flow direction for a total of four models.
The SFP+ version costs slightly less than the Tw-pair version.
