Well there has been a lot of hubbub about IPv6 unique local addressing lately. You know, that address space defined by [RFC 4193](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4193/)? The one that most folks think of as "RFC1918 for IPv6" (It's not that)? Well, we recorded a podcast with [Ed Horley](https://twitter.com/EHorley) over at [modem.show](https://www.modem.show/post/s02e03/) to talk about it. Interested in how ULA is different than GUA (globally unique addressing)? Wanna understand what is broken about it (the list is significant)? Head over and give it a listen, or steam it from [right here](https://anchor.fm/modulate-demodulate/embed/episodes/The-Foibles-and-Frailties-of-IPv6-ULA-e1gvfa8).
