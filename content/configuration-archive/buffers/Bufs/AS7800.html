Tomahawk II 64-port 100 Gb/s 2 RU switch introduced March 2017. 
Build on a single PCB.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010759/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Edgecore-7800-64X.pdf">Design contributed to OCP.</a>
Note that there is a model number change between the OCP submission
and appearance of the data sheet. <i>7800</i> became <i>7816</i>.
<p>
Edge-core has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010759/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS7816-64X.pdf"> data sheet</a> as of
January 18, 2018. This might mean that these are now headed for
the distribution pipeline rather than being merely asperational.
World-wide distributors and resellers are listed on their web page.
As of March 11, 2018, we are looking for confirmation on supplier
web pages that the product is available.
