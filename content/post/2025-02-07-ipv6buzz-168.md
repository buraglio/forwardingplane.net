[I've written](https://www.forwardingplane.net/post/2012-11-09-scinet-a-privileged-few/) [and talked](https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/04/using-faucet-to-build-sc18-network-with/) about [SCinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCinet) many times in the past. As a 20 year emeritus engineer having worked within every group within [SCinet](https://scinet.supercomputing.org), this was a really personally satisfying podcast for me. In [this episode of IP Buzz](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/ipv6-buzz/ipb168-deploying-ipv6-only-wi-fi-at-the-sc24-conference/), we talk through the details of deploying IPv6 mostly as defined by [RFC 8925](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8925) with [Tom Costello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tc0651/) of [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov).
