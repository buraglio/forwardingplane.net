For those that may not be familiar, [The Brothers WISP](http://thebrotherswisp.com/index.php/greg-talks-2-white-papers-troubleshooting-access-anxiety-control/) is a last mile wireless and [Mikrotik](https://www.mikrotik.com) focused podcast (although they cover far, far more than just that). Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting down with them again, this time one on one with [Greg](http://www.gregsowell.com), the mastermind behind all of it (or as I like to call him - "The velvet fog" due to his really smooth and polished podcast delivery). We talk about a whole slew of different things, both technical and not, but the real meat is at the end where we discuss anxiety. We all have our baggage, and many of us aren't comfortable talking about it. We crack that nut wide open and bare it all: that we have it, why, how we deal. As [Jordan Martin](https://twitter.com/bcjordo) also [recently discussed on the Network Collective](https://networkcollective.com/2020/01/were-back/), mental health is important, burnout is real, and in the breakneck speeds of the IT industry we can get caught up in trying to do and know it all. It is important to know that it is totally OK not to.
