    In many environments, the move to virtualization is a path well traveled. My home and lab networks are no exception to this and I&#8217;m sure nearly everyone who reads these pages has at least been exposed to it in one way or another. I have played with nearly all of the virtualization platforms and am firmly in the camp that there will be a large segment of networking that will move to a virtualized platform especially in the data center and campus segments.

    I have been learning and using IPv6 for a quite a while, even before I worked in research and education, back in the ISP days. I thought I should learn it because, frankly, I figured we&#8217;d all be converted to it by now, already whole hog using it like it was the layer 3 addressing mechanism that it is. Flashback: My first IPv6 access was via a tunnel to HE a long, long time ago and before that I was reading what I could about it.

    Working on some MX series routers recently I encountered a problem I&#8217;d never seen before, essentially preventing the configuration from being committed:
buraglio@rtr# commit check re0: error: could not open configuration database (juniper.data+) This is a very annoying problem and is terribly inconvenient as you can probably imagine. So, my first instinct is to drop down to the shell and starting hacking at it UNIX style.
buraglio@rtr&gt;start shell From there I wanted to see the file system and check out the stats of what it thinks we have.

    One of the things that I&#8217;ve always lamented about using non-Cisco hardware is the lack of true 1:1 netflow support. Say what you will about jflow, cflow, sflow&#8230;.there is no substitute for netflow, with sflow being the exception to that since it is a protocol that inherently supports ipv6 and can transport far more than simple network information if configured in certain ways on certain devices.
On newer MX series Juniper routers the game has changed.

    Let me be clear, when I say &#8220;single vendor&#8221; I&#8217;m talking about being &#8220;single vendor&#8221; in what you work on, not necessarily what you install (although one basically forces the other) and what I really mean is multilingual. I&#8217;ll explain after a brief history of why I am the way I am.
I&#8217;m idealistic but I&#8217;m also realistic. I generally propose solutions that I think are best even if it is non-standard or out of current comfort level along with an alternative or two.

    My personal background in computing (specifically networking) is atypical. I have a bachelors in visual arts and only took a handful of computing classes in my relatively long tenure in college. However, I did learn one valuable lesson that has served me pretty well over the 15 or so years I have been doing networking and I&#8217;d bet money any good network engineer that has more than 10 years of experience will nod their head at this and agree.

    As part of a larger fun project I&#8217;m working on (OVS for the ALIX platform; more to come on that once I have it 100% working), I have been playing a lot with OVS. It&#8217;s a great platform, and as others have mentioned, it&#8217;s as close to an SDN reference data plane implementation as we have. I&#8217;d be surprised if many if not all commercial implementations of OpenFlow aren&#8217;t based on OVS.

    About a year ago I did a brief review of the &#8220;new Sonicwall&#8221;, specifically a smaller branch office device that was said should have had all of the features of the larger devices. I proposed that it had some significant limitations (much to the disagreement of a great deal of folks). However, I stand by my statements. If you ignore the fact that firewalls often cause more problems than they solve, that NAT is a nightmarish kludge (and not a security mechanism), and will likely be phased out for better options eventually, the SonicOS I tested was pretty limited as far as what I believe should be features.

    The buzz as of late around the security and networking communities has been about the NSA and their catalog or spy toolkit. I&#8217;ve spent time in my career thinking about and doing infosec and I did a brief stint working for the FBI in a project called NCDIR. I like to think that I can provide at least a peripherally competent commentary about it [take it with a grain of salt].

    I am an absolutely huge fan of statistical and instrumentation data, especially when it comes to traffic analysis, visualization and baselining. I&#8217;ve rambled on about the importance of it at every opportunity. As a result of that, I have been doing work with netflow and netflow-like data for a fairly long time. My first collector was the OSU Flow tools based stuff back around 13 years ago. From there I played with all kinds of netflow tools, both commercial and open source, finally settling most of my focus on nfdump and nfsen.
