The model number seems to have changed slightly between first light
to OCP and actual product. 
This design was submitted to OCP in March 2016. There is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010701/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5900-54.pdf">OCP specification</a>.
<p>
The Qumram has 8 packet ram chips, each with 32M x 16 bits-wide. The memory
part number is K4A4G165WD by Samsung.

<b> Update</b>
<p>
There is now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010701/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5912-54X_Datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a> as of 
September 2017. A more recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010701/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS5912-54X_DS_R13_20190527.pdf"> 
</a>data sheet is more specific about the
size of the external packet memory [6GB]. 
Info on the opencompute.org site seems to say that there
is now a varient with TCAM. Presumably that means <i>external</i> TCAM since
it seems there must be TCAM.
