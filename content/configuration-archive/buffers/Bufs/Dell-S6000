Dell is a long-time user of Broadcom network switch components. The S6000 is available with front-to-back or back-to-front
airflow and AC or DC power.
They put out a data sheet for the S6000 switch in August 2013 in anticipation of production quantities of the Trident II. 
A thousand page manual was released in October.
Unlike other Dell network equipment, no price is available and the switch cannot be ordered on-line. [December 2013] BCM56850 (Trident2)
