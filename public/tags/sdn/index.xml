      <title>Building a dynamic security infrastructure [in a box - with SDN]</title>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-a-dynamic-security-infrastructure-in-a-box-with-sdn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago I wrote about building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/07/building-a-secured-network-in-a-box/&#34;&gt;secure network in a box&lt;/a&gt;. Over a weekend I decided to revisit this concept thanks to a colleague at work wanting to do something similar. It got me thinking “a lot has changed since I last did this” and it felt like time to revisit it. Well, disappointment wasn’t in the cards because it’s easier, smarter, and more flexible now that it was back then. As I noted back in 2013 when I wrote that last post, OVS was a lot less well traveled and, frankly, there was not a reasonable controller that I could use in production for OpenFlow integration. I’ve since standardized on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.proxmox.com/en/&#34;&gt;ProxMox&lt;/a&gt; for my lab and production virtualization and have espoused on every available occasion the usefulness of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.faucet.nz&#34;&gt;Faucet SDN controller&lt;/a&gt;. Both play fundamental roles in this project. This is significantly easier than I expected - primarily due to the use of faucet for controlling the OVS switch. It’s fairly straightforward, so I won’t go into the step by step details here since the projects have good install and support docs. Proxmox has support for OVS, so just install it using apt and create an OVS switch in the GUI interface. Faucet has &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/&#34;&gt;amazingly complete documentation&lt;/a&gt; and even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/installation.html#installing-on-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;raspberry pi image&lt;/a&gt; (if you’re still thinking “OpenFlow is dead, isn’t it?”, have a listen to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ipspace.net/2019/04/using-faucet-to-build-sc18-network-with.html&#34;&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; I did with Ivan Pepelnjak). From there, install a &lt;a href=&#34;https://securityonion.net/&#34;&gt;security option VM&lt;/a&gt; (or any other tool you want to capture data with). Once you have the OVS switch, the controller, and the VM up and running getting data to it is as simple as issuing the comments to configure a controller. I my case the command was:```
sudo ovs-vsctl set-controller vmbr4 tcp:10.16.9.12:6653 tcp:10.16.9.12:6654&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-In my lab design the architecture was as such ![Faucet OVS Proxmox Security](https://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Faucet-OVS-Proxmox-Security.jpg &#34;Faucet OVS Proxmox Security.jpg&#34;) The two switches on the right are physical and span all uplink data via two physical ports into my proxmox host. Everything else is done virtually in OVS. Once you have the controller setup, the data coming in, and the host listening, you can validate you have the correct controller, interfaces and ports in ovs.```&#34; data-lang=&#34;In my lab design the architecture was as such ![Faucet OVS Proxmox Security](https://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Faucet-OVS-Proxmox-Security.jpg &#34;Faucet OVS Proxmox Security.jpg&#34;) The two switches on the right are physical and span all uplink data via two physical ports into my proxmox host.

      <title>Faucet: Enterprise OpenFlow in production</title>

&lt;p&gt;Remember OpenFlow? It was the media and marketing darling for the better part of 5 years as “the machine” conflated OpenFlow with SDN and SDN with - almost literally - everything. &amp;ldquo;Still Does Nothing&amp;rdquo; was a common phrase uttered around those of us that had run large scale, complex networks for a long time. Quietly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://faucet-sdn.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;and mostly&lt;/a&gt;, out of the fickle media and blogosphere eye, a scrappy little SDN project called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet&#34;&gt;faucet&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet&#34;&gt;diligently plugging away&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; making easy to use, production quality, well documented, and very stable code that runs OpenFlow networks quite happily in production and at scale. Oh, did I mention that it&amp;rsquo;s also got a very small footprint? Did I also mention that we&amp;rsquo;ve built a multi-terabit network that scales, transiting IPv4, IPv6, L2/L3 switching as well as routing? Or that faucet can control switches from multiple vendors, including P4 vendors who provide a P4-to-OF bridge, and interoperates with non-SDN networks? Or (and possibly most importantly) that faucet provides automated integration tests, allowing many bugs to be caught early (sometimes even by the switch vendor) before shipping new releases? Well, I should probably mention those things. I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have been involved in SDN off and on since around 2009, and I can emphatically say that of the production SDN and OpenFlow networks that I have been intimately involved in, this combination of hardware, software and people has been, hands down, the most rewarding and most supportable. In fact, this has been so supportable and great to work with, we migrated our production branch office over to a set of faucet controlled SDN switches, and will soon migrate first hop routing over to our robust faucet system. &amp;ldquo;However did you do this?!?!&amp;rdquo; you might be inclined to say. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked, because I am going to tell you.    First, though, there should be some design goals. As many of the naysayers of SDN will happy point out, &amp;ldquo;what problem are you trying to solve?&amp;rdquo; to that end, here is what our design goals were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run all layer 2 in via faucet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove need to log into any network elements after deployment (other than firmware updates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralize management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretch goal to NFV BGP, do first hop L3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy enough, right? It really is. For our deployment we leveraged Aruba 2930F switches giving us a wealth of 1G copper ports and a handful of 10G SFP+ ports. Luckily, we already had this gear because as so many that have tried to deploy openflow in the past have seen, all hardware is not created equally. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.faucet.org.nz/&#34;&gt;faucet foundation&lt;/a&gt; has published a list of requirements for support, and there are a reasonable number of vendors that actually conform. The real key that I learned in this process is that without proper vendor support (which had been several lacking in the past), and without multi-table, OpenFlow is not positioned for success. It comes down to using the right tools for the job, and OpenFlow (as well as SDN) is no different. Originally this post was to detail the process of building this network, much like posts in the past where there has been a “do this, then do that” how-to, it’s more or less unnecessary here. Why? The faucet project is serious, well documented and generally here to work. The expectation is that this is not an enclave, or a science experiment, or a lab. It’s a production network with real people and real traffic. Read that again. The expectation is that this is stable, supportable, and can do in ready to use day-to-day. And it doesn’t disappoint. Installing is a snap, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/tutorials/first_time.html&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; for faucet is fantastic and complete. If there is something missing or a question, the developers are incredibly responsive and very quick to answer and address any issues that may arise. It’s extremely low footprint - it runs very well on a raspberry pi and does not tax a raspberry pi series 2, even with the gauge telemetry interface (there is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/installation.html#installing-on-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;pre-built pi OS&lt;/a&gt; for anyone that would prefer a more turnkey option). You may be thinking “_But Nick, I need my CLI!!!_” You’re covered - and here is why: the developers use this system. They run real networks with it. Every day. They know what is necessary to manage and maintain a real production network and sometimes that means troubleshooting. Like many engineers that learned on traditional network equipment, most of us prefer a CLI to troubleshoot, so the inclusion of this feature from the controller is not really a surprise. The fctl command provides a reasonable visibility into the operations of the controller and can be augmented and scripted.```

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;display-labels DISPLAY_LABELS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;list of labels to filter display by (default all)
```Monitoring is also taken into account in the form of the gauge interface, which provides a nearly-real-time telemetry stream of important and useful information. Leveraging both the wealth of topological information that the controller has at its disposal and a familiar &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prometheus&#34;&gt;prometheus&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/&#34;&gt;grafana&lt;/a&gt; back / front end interface, the oft-touted notion of streaming telemetry is fully - and quite capably - realized. From the perspective of a networking monitoring and statistics geek, this is the cat’s meow. Very, very data rich. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grafana-screencap.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grafana-screencap-1024x275.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A simple diagram of our office network pretty well explains the decoupled control plane architecture. Keep it simple, architect for success. Fundamentally SDN networks should be designed like other networks, redundant systems, good monitoring, out of band access. A good design principle is that if you wouldn’t do it on a traditional network, you probably shouldn’t do it for an SDN based network.   &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/faunet-office.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/faunet-office.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Don’t trust me? Fair enough, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.waikato.ac.nz/research/units/wand.shtml&#34;&gt;University of Waikato&lt;/a&gt; interface &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.redcables.wand.nz/d/000000003/redcables-bgp?orgId=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For more interface on the deployment at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wand.net.nz/&#34;&gt;WAND&lt;/a&gt;, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://redcables.wand.nz/&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t be disappointed.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;My take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-and-running-it&#34;&gt;Building and running it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/&#34;&gt;documentation for faucet&lt;/a&gt; is indescribably better than any other SDN project I have worked with over the span of nearly 10 years. &lt;strong&gt;It’s also supportable.&lt;/strong&gt; My office has been running the enterprise network off of faucet for a while now, without issue, and it meets our design goals [stretch goal of BGP NFV is still in process - testing is successful]). It is easy to manage and very information rich. I can see security minded folks being very interested in the ACLs and other such options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;telemetry-and-analytics&#34;&gt;Telemetry and analytics    &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Where so many others in this space are talking about their Telemetry solution, this one is already here, complete, and usable. Frankly, I am fully comfortable running a production network on this technology, operationally it is truly easier. From a security perspective, the options added scale well and deliver on their promise. Where OpenFlow was once touted as the networking silver bullet (without a lot of real stick time to prove or disprove it), it has now fallen comfortable into a nice, supportable model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;up-next&#34;&gt;Up next….    &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this is cool, wait until &lt;a href=&#34;https://sc18.supercomputing.org/&#34;&gt;SuperComputing 18&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re deploying a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6461072411969363968/&#34;&gt;first-of-it’s kind network&lt;/a&gt;, all controlled by FAUCET.&lt;/p&gt;

```Monitoring is also taken into account in the form of the gauge interface, which provides a nearly-real-time telemetry stream of important and useful information. Leveraging both the wealth of topological information that the controller has at its disposal and a familiar &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prometheus&#34;&gt;prometheus&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/&#34;&gt;grafana&lt;/a&gt; back / front end interface, the oft-touted notion of streaming telemetry is fully - and quite capably - realized. From the perspective of a networking monitoring and statistics geek, this is the cat’s meow. Very, very data rich. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grafana-screencap.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grafana-screencap-1024x275.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A simple diagram of our office network pretty well explains the decoupled control plane architecture. Keep it simple, architect for success. Fundamentally SDN networks should be designed like other networks, redundant systems, good monitoring, out of band access. A good design principle is that if you wouldn’t do it on a traditional network, you probably shouldn’t do it for an SDN based network.   &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/faunet-office.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/faunet-office.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Don’t trust me? Fair enough, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.waikato.ac.nz/research/units/wand.shtml&#34;&gt;University of Waikato&lt;/a&gt; interface &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.redcables.wand.nz/d/000000003/redcables-bgp?orgId=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For more interface on the deployment at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wand.net.nz/&#34;&gt;WAND&lt;/a&gt;, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://redcables.wand.nz/&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t be disappointed.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;My take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-and-running-it&#34;&gt;Building and running it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/&#34;&gt;documentation for faucet&lt;/a&gt; is indescribably better than any other SDN project I have worked with over the span of nearly 10 years. &lt;strong&gt;It’s also supportable.&lt;/strong&gt; My office has been running the enterprise network off of faucet for a while now, without issue, and it meets our design goals [stretch goal of BGP NFV is still in process - testing is successful]). It is easy to manage and very information rich. I can see security minded folks being very interested in the ACLs and other such options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;telemetry-and-analytics&#34;&gt;Telemetry and analytics    &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Where so many others in this space are talking about their Telemetry solution, this one is already here, complete, and usable. Frankly, I am fully comfortable running a production network on this technology, operationally it is truly easier. From a security perspective, the options added scale well and deliver on their promise. Where OpenFlow was once touted as the networking silver bullet (without a lot of real stick time to prove or disprove it), it has now fallen comfortable into a nice, supportable model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;up-next&#34;&gt;Up next….    &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this is cool, wait until &lt;a href=&#34;https://sc18.supercomputing.org/&#34;&gt;SuperComputing 18&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re deploying a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6461072411969363968/&#34;&gt;first-of-it’s kind network&lt;/a&gt;, all controlled by FAUCET.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The rush to automation and the IT pendulum</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-rush-to-automation-and-the-it-pendulum/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 14:20:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-rush-to-automation-and-the-it-pendulum/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the venerable &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ipspace.net&#34;&gt;Ivan Pepelnjak&lt;/a&gt; published a very insightful article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/10/why-is-network-automation-such-hot-topic.html&#34;&gt;automation becoming such a popular topic&lt;/a&gt; that was spawned by an email from one of his readers. I found this article to be spot on, and wanted to add a bit of my own opinion into the automation pie, as I have been spending a lot of time on automation as it related to existing networks as well as into SDN based environments. There is a link, and I wanted to explore it a bit more whilst adding a healthy dose of my opinion. A very large part of the automation push is the IT pendulum swing. Like those of us that worked in the burgeoning ISP world, automating was born of necessity. Except - we didn&amp;rsquo;t call it automation. Most of us didn&amp;rsquo;t call it anything, it was sysadmin scripting at worst and full blown orchestration at best. And there were even commercial platforms (see broadband provisioning tools). However, like many of us that were in the early ISP days, at the very least we had some rudimentary programming and scripting skills because we either had to develop them to stay afloat or we came from an early applied computer science background. Those skills, like a lot of other things, also have the pendulum swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;https-media-giphy-com-media-tttkr0wqcuct2-giphy-gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/ttTKR0wqCUCt2/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pendulum&#34;&gt;The pendulum.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the pendulum in terms of computing, as it&amp;rsquo;s the easiest to quantify. Computing went from centralized (i.e. the mainframe) to decentralized (i.e. the desktop PC). Now we&amp;rsquo;re moving back into the &amp;ldquo;centralized&amp;rdquo; model in the push to cloud (ok, that may be a tad different, but conceptually it&amp;rsquo;s the same - work with me). Moving computationally expensive operations out of a single, personal system into a larger resource while reducing the overhead of the end station. Think &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixelbook-RAM-128GB-GA00122-US/dp/B075JSK7TR/ref=sr_1_4_acs_osp_osp19-42c2a08e-2d_2?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1539871559&amp;amp;sr=1-4-acs&amp;amp;keywords=chromebook&amp;amp;tag=crverifiedexp-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=42c2a08e-2d48-4a89-8acb-841bc830f277&amp;amp;linkCode=oas&amp;amp;cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.42c2a08e-2d48-4a89-8acb-841bc830f277&amp;amp;cv_ct_pg=search&amp;amp;cv_ct_wn=osp-search&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-inline&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=qgIuG&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=chromebook&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=OLHr0&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=53b688eb-671a-4acd-886f-dc89fa36d3d2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=4d4ed571-35bf-4be9-860c-7deaa1ce8cc4&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=QNRHZW6VWAWZ13HMDGF7&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B075JSK7TR&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=53b688eb-671a-4acd-886f-dc89fa36d3d2&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=OLHr0&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B075JSK7TR&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-inline&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=chromebook&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=qgIuG&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=QNRHZW6VWAWZ13HMDGF7&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=4d4ed571-35bf-4be9-860c-7deaa1ce8cc4&#34;&gt;Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; or VDI thin client. Dramatic changes do not happen quickly in the networking world, and there are a number of simple reasons why&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean time to replacement is somewhere between 5 and 10 years depending on the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards for networking take &lt;strong&gt;For-ev-er&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even if the time to replace lifecycle is short, the windows for new tech standards, vendor implementation, and knowledge dissemination to occur rarely, if ever, line up. What this means is that new tech is very slow to adopt in the network world. Even I make the mistake of being far too impatient with this process sometimes, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bcjordo?lang=en&#34;&gt;Jordan Marti&lt;/a&gt;n called me out on in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenetworkcollective.com/2018/02/otc-nfd17/&#34;&gt;Network Collective podcast&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago (p.s., it&amp;rsquo;s a fun listen - check it out). Back to automation. As IT changed in non-service providers from a questionable money sink to a potentially critical revenue generating business and communications environment the generalist IT workers slowly morphed into the specialists. Developers, Network Engineers, Systems Engineers, phone system admins, etc. As this occurred, the disciplines fractured and the skillsets refined, and in many cases lost the generalist foundation in trade for a deeply focused skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sdn&#34;&gt;The SDN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade or two of this shift, SDN blows onto the scene. SDN, as it emerges and becomes the new marketing darling of many a start up and huge company alike, promises to destroy boundaries and obsolete basically everything - equipment, skill sets, people, cars, dogs, cats, water, air&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.everything. The issue is that from a few research products that had ground breaking ideas came a monster. As over-hyped, over-marketed, and under developed juggernaut that had a different meaning to anyone you asked. Whole some folks plugged away quietly on &lt;a href=&#34;https://faucet.nz/&#34;&gt;projects that actually wor&lt;/a&gt;k, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34;&gt;experimented&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://esnetupdates.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/esnets-nick-buraglio-leading-scinets-first-sdn-effort-at-sc15/&#34;&gt;deployments meant to function in production&lt;/a&gt;, the marketing machines created more and more hype and delivered only a few promises. This is the far out pendulum swing. Many operators recoiled. Enterprises said &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;, and folks trying to push boundaries with new deployments were saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;wait, let&amp;rsquo;s figure out &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; before we ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Then the pendulum started swinging back. Automation is back, and now there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; and tools, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re centering on a safer alternative that conservative enterprises can deploy safely and without event. We&amp;rsquo;re back to the fundamentals and the basics of what worked long ago - but now we have help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;My take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, I am still believer in the fundamentals that something resembling SDN brings to the table and have been working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://sc18.supercomputing.org/blog/&#34;&gt;significant SDN projects even recently&lt;/a&gt;, including moving our entire office over to FAUCET controlled switches (more on this soon), and a fair amount of work in the segment routing / PCE space. However, I am not a fan of the marketing machine, especially when there is a poverty of useful data to build said marketing from, and said marketing contains an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/&#34;&gt;overabundance of sensational FUD&lt;/a&gt;. New technology needs to be supportable to be deployed, and it happens, very, very slowly. Much like IPv4 to IPv6, Frame Relay to ATM, and circuit switched to packet switched, as SDN technologies become more and more exposed and easier to use, they become &amp;ldquo;just another thing&amp;rdquo;, and that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating an internal span port inside proxmox OVS</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/creating-internal-span-port-inside-proxmox-ovs/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 03:49:58 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/creating-internal-span-port-inside-proxmox-ovs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few years I have moved all of my virtualization to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.proxmox.com/en/&#34;&gt;proxmox&lt;/a&gt; and docker. Seeing as I like to look at packets because I am a closet security guy, and being as I have been working off-and-on on a security project in recent times, I wanted to be able to span a port not only from a hardware switch, but also within my software switches. I had been using linux bridge, which I am not a fan of, so when I started down this path I did not look hard to find a way to do so under that platform. Instead I used it as an opportunity to move some of the internal bridges to &lt;a href=&#34;http://openvswitch.org/&#34;&gt;OpenVSwitch&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to create an OVS span port internally. I had experience with OVS in the past for SDN work that I was doing, but I had never created a mirror port. I briefly thought about using OpenFlow to do it, but the unnecessary complexity was off putting. Instead I chose to create a simple mirror of a span port from my switch. So, traffic flow goes as such: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OVS-SPAN-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OVS-SPAN-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     This was fairly trivial, and I was seeing packets in no time. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go through creating an OVS bridge in proxmox, there are lots of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Open_vSwitch&#34;&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; on how to do that. Once you have your switch port SPAN up and running, and the physical interface in the OVS bridge, you essentially just need to add the following: Create the mirror```
ovs-vsctl &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash;id=@m create mirror name=span &amp;ndash; add bridge vmbr1 mirrors @m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Find your ports that you want to mirror - you&#39;ll need the physical port if consuming from a real switch like I am, and the software port of the virtualized analyzer.  Remember, in OVS anything you want to mess with is going to have a UUID.

&lt;p&gt;You can also do this with the UUID```
ovs-vsctl set mirror span select_src_port=42dbd5a9-27c6-4f1b-958b-943f67b6801b select_dst_port=42dbd5a9-27c6-4f1b-958b-943f67b6801b&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted mine to go to an internal host running some analytics software (on interface veth100i9)```&#34; data-lang=&#34;Now that we have the source of our mirror we just need to send it somewhere. I wanted mine to go to an internal host running some analytics software (on interface veth100i9)```&#34;&gt;ovs-vsctl -- --id=@veth100i9 get port veth100i9 -- set mirror span output-port=@veth100i9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Log into your host and do a tcpdump on whatever interface is mapped to veth100i9 and you should see packets flowing. A few tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify your span from the hardware switch is working before diving into the software stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re doing this is proxmox, be aware that proxmox networking stack can be unforgiving when you much around outside of their environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will not persist across reboots. Add it to /etc/network/interfaces manually to keep it after a restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Why I care about Segment Routing</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/care-segment-routing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:54:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/care-segment-routing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;em&gt;Going against my normal “just get the content out there” methodology, I’ve been mulling over this blog post since July of 2016.  Segment routing is such a beautifully elegant solution I have had trouble articulating that fact. WAN technologies are squarely within my wheelhouse, and this one fits in so well I was going over and over the post never really satisfied with it, continuing to find mistakes and decided to just get it out there. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a WAN guy by chance and opportunity, and a service provider engineer and architect by choice (and also chance and opportunity), segment routing (SR) is one of those wonderful new technologies that keeps rearing its head over and over in recent days - and it&amp;rsquo;s already playing in the big leagues. SR is supported by many of the large network equipment providers including Cisco, Juniper, and Nokia (Alcatel-Lucent), and as I have just learned, Arista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this a notable tech you may want to pay attention to? Wide area and service provider networks have a longer mean time before replacement. They don’t change topology or architecture nearly as often and the gear typically has higher cost due to things like deeper interface buffers, more complex feature sets, larger TCAM for things like route tables, as well as increased redundancy features. Managing a WAN has a different feel and a different set of problems. Complex overlays and traffic engineering often play a role in wide area networks. Many an attempt to reduce the the complexity of WANs has been made and SDN is creeping its way into some pretty large networks. When a network of any size is built, there comes a tipping point when managing things by hand, even with great documentation, is too daunting and cannot be done efficiently. Automation is key. Simplicity is paramount. Anyone that has ever managed a large MPLS network knows this. So, when I started looking at segment routing, I was cautiously optimistic - it had many attributes that were comfortable to a seasoned WAN engineer and yet abstracted many of the complexities of the networks that we&amp;rsquo;d been running for years. In order to really understand the benefits that SR brings to the table, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the current landscape. When one builds a large MPLS network there are incremental elements that all build from each other in order to work. If one is broken or problematic, the problem will trickle up the stack. Fundamentally, the stack for a very vanilla MPLs WAN contains the following elements (top down):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client service interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overlay, L3VPN, VPLS, ePIPE/PseudoWire/VLL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BGP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label Distribution, LDP, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IGP, IS-IS or OSPFv2/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethernet, SONET, DS1/DS3/E1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optical transport or other last mile and long haul outside plant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add into this list the complications of traffic engineering, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a mix of things that are fairly daunting to all but the most experienced engineers. What segment routing provides is a way to remove several layers of this and simplify what is arguably the most complex and least understood element: Traffic Engineering. Segment routing allows for the selection of an entire path, from the ingress of the network to the egress port, all outside of the IGPs shortest path table. It is often labeled as &amp;ldquo;source routing&amp;rdquo; which will inevitably create feeling of disgust, dread, and distain from a network engineer and panic from the security folks. I choose not to label SR as &amp;ldquo;source routing&amp;rdquo; because of the negative connotation associated with that technological approach. Instead, I would rather use the term &amp;ldquo;deliberate path selection&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and this can be automated. That&amp;rsquo;s right. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;SDN&amp;rdquo;. Utilizing a tool called a path computational engine or &amp;ldquo;PCE&amp;rdquo;, these paths can be selected based on any number of criteria including latency, hop count, load, time of day, phase of the moon, mood of the boss, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to get to spend some quality time at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/srr1/&#34;&gt;special event&lt;/a&gt; recently. Interesting discussions were had, many a thing was learned. A few of the other attendees wrote up some great info on segment routing, including some use cases, which can be found here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend taking a view of the talks from some folks using SR on some pretty significant networks - it&amp;rsquo;s worth your time if you&amp;rsquo;re really interested in throwing down with segment routing.  But what did this tell &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? Lets look further into SR and see why it&amp;rsquo;s become so attractive to large, geographically diverse networks. First, SR builds on an existing knowledgeable. Far more people exist in the market that already know MPLS. The understand labels, they understand overlays, and they have vast experience with virtual circuits. Service providers are very likely MPLS based if they operate at any scale and offer typical ISP services. MPLS is well traveled, and even though there may be reasons that&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, it&amp;rsquo;s the devil we know. Other SDN technologies are either fairly green (l&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ipspace.net/2015/12/running-open-daylight-in-production.html#more&#34;&gt;et me tell you about running a production openflow experience&lt;/a&gt;) or are primarily focused on the data center, which as I will adamantly insist is a very different beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large scale service providers have a very different redundancy model. Attempting to apply campus or enterprise redundancy to a service provider does not scale and it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t affordable. SR leverages the same models that MPLS does, it realies heavily on the IGP, leveraging a TLV within IS-IS. That brings me to IS-IS. Most service providers leverage IS-IS as their internal gateway protocol due to it&amp;rsquo;s ability to carry multiple routed protocols at once, leverage multi-topology, and the fact that it does not rely on the protocol it is routing for connectivity like OSPF does. SR is more-or-less an extension to IS-IS. Overlapping skill set #2. The other option, and this is a big one, is that there are multiple vendors that supported, as stated above. This is a big deal as int provides that &amp;ldquo;throat to choke&amp;rdquo; that a lot of emerging technologies just do not really have yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that it &amp;ldquo;fails open”? What’s not to love about falling back to an IGP rather than ceasing to process packets?  Lets do a for-instance use-case. Within your SR network you provision a path that takes a path with more hops but has less congestion. Create your label stack and away you go* Of that path fails, the traffic falls back to the standard routing table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like MPLS (of which I am a fan, FWIW), this technology is better suited for a larger network with multiple paths, this could be any number of  environments such as large camps networks, large scale data centers geographically diverse environments connected by multiple WAN circuits, and of course, service and content providers. This tech is quite simply full of win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*greatly simplified =)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buzzwords, technology, terminology, and the interconnection of modern networking</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/buzzwords-technology-terminology-interconnection-modern-networking/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 16:33:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/buzzwords-technology-terminology-interconnection-modern-networking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m way overdue for a soapbox session &amp;ndash; I found this one in my drafts and thought it was something I needed to put out there. It&amp;rsquo;s already dated in terminology but that actually helps make the point - it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep up. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets throw this out there: social media can be exhausting. Do not misunderstand me, it’s a great tool for communication, obtaining and disseminating information as well as standard goofing around. It’s also a serious business for a huge amount of companies. I use it extensively myself and I’ll assume there is a pretty good chance you followed a tweet or other social media link to get here. However, for a green network engineer looking for a path forward it can be a bit daunting. Those my age never had the social media aspect to deal with when we were learning, we may have had IRC or other haphazard back channels to bounce ideas and questions, but for the most part, the resources were far more limited than they are today. In actuality, I believe that this was a bit of an advantage that we had over today: we were often forced to bulldoze through problems, making mistakes that taught us deep understandings of the inner working of that given technology. It also sucked a lot more [time].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I right? Maybe. Maybe not. Who is to say? These days I take full advantage of the wealth of information that is the internet for both personal and professional tasks, I would be a tad crazy not to. It&amp;rsquo;s why I write the tech stuff I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that, though, comes so many buzzwords and so much hype that it is very easy for an aspiring network engineer (or any professional IT hopeful, student or casual techie) to become completely overwhelmed by simply looking at twitter and following a handful of key players. I’ve been doing what I do with networks since the 1990s and even I have been feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of “Network Engineer Killer” or “Must know” technologies being thrown around in the last few years. It&amp;rsquo;s both exciting, encouraging and at the same time enough to make even the most grizzly engineer feel snowed under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait for it……Cloud. No wait, DevOps. Containers! NO! NO! SDN! They&amp;rsquo;re all cool and they&amp;rsquo;re all important. They are also a lot to take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a great deal about DevOps and SDN lately. Being a really, really bad developer, DevOps is a tad uncomfortable for me. It is an obviously useful skill set: Understanding code and automation. It’s powerful and &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; make your professional life easier. Do you need to obsess over it? Probably not (do you need to obsess over any of it?!?). Remember that internet thing that I mentioned before? Yeah, there are a lot of resources there. Search engines are your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you need to know the concepts? For sure. Guess what, though? There are a &lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt; of resources for that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was brainstorming this, I mind-mapped some of the things that jumped into my brain [&lt;a href=&#34;https://mindnode.com/&#34;&gt;mindnode pro&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic app for this, I highly recommend it]. Things that get a lot of attention and maybe deserve a cursory glance. Lets break them down in a simple-ish and concise-ish manner and understand that by the time of this writing I’m positive it will be outdated and there will be some new whiz-bang thing that the marketing machine will be saying is the “something-killer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the high level things I see thrown around a lot. For what it’s worth, OpenDayLight has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/project/technical-overview&#34;&gt;a page&lt;/a&gt; with some definitions that is pretty good, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Tech-Relationships.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Tech-Relationships.png&#34; alt=&#34;Networking Tech Relationships&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; all-encompassing and is likely missing major things, however, the point is really not to be accurate as much as it is to demonstrate that there is a &lt;strong&gt;monumental&lt;/strong&gt; amount of scope that is in some ways interconnected and in other ways completely autonomous. It is also pretty clear that due to the nature of what “DevOps” is, it has ties into many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest take-away is that the communication paths need to be there - Better communication between these specializations makes for better, more secure, more usable tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is how the DevOps is done, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what it is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am really getting at here is that there is no need to get overwhelmed. You don’t need to know all of this stuff. If you know a little about most of it and a lot about one or two topics, then in my opinion you are doing really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best advice to any new IT person is not to know everything but to know where to find it - and then share what you learned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Interdomain SDN part 3</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-interdomain-sdn-part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 04:37:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-interdomain-sdn-part-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34;&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/01/sdn-across-the-wan-part-deux-primitives/&#34;&gt;interdomain SDN&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, work is being done, smart people are thinking about it and building ways to make it a reality. Not being one to give up on an idea, I gave &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1anAaqWR8wmzKO5fqidDy9QJXW4RiVshX9Miq3PoDv9E/edit&#34;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt; in may at &lt;a href=&#34;http://chinog.org/meetings/chi-nog-05/&#34;&gt;ChiNOG&lt;/a&gt;  on what my take on what that architecture should be. I (we) propose that the use of existing protocols such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5575&#34;&gt;BGP FlowSpec&lt;/a&gt; will make this realistically deployable and maintainable given some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dwcarder/sdn-ix-demo&#34;&gt;simple, pluggable middleware&lt;/a&gt;. As work continues to happen on this, my belief is that this is a very sound (and simple) concept. The middleware is modular and flexible enough that it can stand alone or plug into an existing code base such as ODL or Ryu. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc15blog.blogspot.com/2015/11/simplifying-worlds-most-powerful.html&#34;&gt;I work on the SDN deployment&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sc15.org&#34;&gt;annual international supercomputing conference&lt;/a&gt;, and work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.es.net/network-r-and-d/workshops/&#34;&gt;SDN for scientific networking workshop&lt;/a&gt;,  I become more and more convinced that there needs to be an operationally viable and simple way to support these types of networks in ways that are thin and simple since it is a newer concept and some of the protocols involved (e.g. OpenFlow) is still in its infancy.  Here is the video of the talk for anyone interested in listening to me talk about it for 20 minutes. As a reference, this is a great talk from the same conference on BGP FlowSpec that adds a lot of credence to the use of it as a policy dissemination protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brocade Vyatta Install and OpenFlow 1.3 on ICX 7450</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/brocade-vyatta-install-and-openflow-1-3-on-icx-7450/</link>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/brocade-vyatta-install-and-openflow-1-3-on-icx-7450/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a need to test OpenFlow on the brocade ICX 7450 for a fairly good sized, high visibility &lt;a href=&#34;http://scinet.supercomputing.org&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;. The basic goal is pretty simple, Layer2 path provisioning. Straightforward and fairly well supported in OpenFlow, even from the early days. To do this, the idea was to use a turnkey platform, that way there is one throat to choke if there are issues. I landed on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www1.brocade.com/forms/jsp/vyatta-controller/download.jsp&#34;&gt;Brocade Vyatta controller&lt;/a&gt; (which is essentially ODL), and the ICX. Below is a rough account of getting this up and working to the point of testing. For the purposes of this I used BVC 1.3 and an ICX 7450. The docs for the BVC are actually pretty good if you read them. I found the google searching for the docs led to &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; links to brocade being 404 errors. My guess is that they restructured their site and did not alias anything. Minor frustration since my guess is that most folks search using a search engine rather than going to the site and searching from there. The link to the configuration guide I used for the ICX is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brocade.com/content/brocade/en/backend-content/pdf-page.html?/content/dam/common/documents/content-types/configuration-guide/fastiron-08030-sdnguide.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Once I grabbed the software, which requires registration, I went on to try to build this on CentOS 6.6. After some hurdles that I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect, I went and actually read the doc for BVC and found that ubuntu is a requirement. Another minor annoyance, but surmountable pretty easily. Enterprise customers are probably not going to want to have a one-off from RHEL/CentOS even if I don&amp;rsquo;t have a strong preference either way. Now that the VM is up and running with just over the minimum requirements, time to log in and get to work. This is assuming you have the code actually on the server already.```

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the connection to the controller from the controller can be accomplished by using the included tool: /opt/bvc/bin/taillog which operates just like you think, by tailing a log file. Checking for capability can be pretty easily accomplished by looking at the restconf modules:```

This is a true statement, however, I made a bad assumption that it was in _all_ code for that platform. Not so. After banging around and reading release notes as well as contacting my SE, I found that the code that it shipped with did _not_ support openflow, so I would need to upgrade it. _The ICX 7450 (and probably others) requires at least Version 08.0.30aa for OpenFlow support.

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts: OpenFlow wants to use SSL by default. When configuring this it failed in a way that is not intuitive &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. To get it running quickly, you need to disable SSL, which I absolutely &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; recommended for anything production). If you see anything other than this, the OpenFlow connection isn&amp;rsquo;t working```

&lt;p&gt;To make this work over SSL requires pulling the certificates into the device from the controller. I am still working on this for consideration in a production environment. Path explorer has most of the interesting bits in it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;BVC-4&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Other handy commands:```

&lt;p&gt;```The topology explorer is pretty cool, lots of eye candy. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BVC-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;BVC-1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Random Thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restarting the BVC causes the topology to need to rebuild, as one would expect. The ICX took longer to show up in the controller than I expected. In fact, it never recovered until I intervened manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brocade ICX randomly rebooted while attempting to scp the bootloader code. I never figured out why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ICX stopped responding to SSH for some reason. The only way I could recover it was to reboot. Concerning from a management standpoint, but I suspect it was an anomaly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post I&amp;rsquo;ll explore the actual provisioning and the SSL configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brocade does a double down on SDN</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/brocade-does-a-double-down-on-sdn/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2015 16:09:11 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/brocade-does-a-double-down-on-sdn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day 9&lt;/a&gt;, I have spent more and more time mentally grinding on what Brocade is doing. I have been a pretty vocal critic of the foundry hardware and software platform since my first experience with it years and years ago. I found it to be lacking in completed features, Layer 3 functionality and general stability.&lt;br /&gt;
This is one reason that anyone reading this should take pause and think about the background this post is sourcing from and how much of a shift it is. I tend to be a pretty harsh critic and have (more than once) been labeled as irreverent when it comes to what is stated in the network and security industry, instead focusing on what is actually necessary in a production network. Brocade has added some good products and features, keeping their SDN features at the forefront, as expected. These are great, but while useful and innovataive, I am less interested in those technical abilities. Brocade has been a long standing icon in the SDN and specifically in the openflow and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org&#34;&gt;OpenDayLight&lt;/a&gt; space since the very early days. In fact, from an outsiders perspective they&amp;rsquo;ve bet their networking arm on it. They were one of the first to market and are able to make software changes quickly and add significant features due to the fact that their larger boxes are FPGA based. This is where it gets interesting for me as someone that had to manage large Foundry/Brocade networks for a number of years and who sports the scars and experiences to prove it. Knowing that the majority of the issues with their platform were software related things like lack of full featured protocols, buggy Layer 3 features and their infamously poor multicast support, the fact that they are laser focused on software defined networking has my wheels turning, and let me tell you why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brocade is slurping up pretty much all of the thought leaders, idea producers, and game changers in the SDN community. This isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly ground breaking news, but it is worth repeating because it is significant. It signals, in a very public way, that they are not messing around. They&amp;rsquo;re embracing SDN and they are ready to stop selling sugar water and change the [networking]world. There is a related branch to this, bear with me, I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brocade purchased &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brocade.com/launch/vyatta/&#34;&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt;, a completely software based company and they did not just absorb the IP and rebadge it. They are actively integrating it, as a product, into their portfolio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brocade is &lt;strong&gt;supporting&lt;/strong&gt; an open sourced based commercialized SDN controller. This signals that they are ready for someone to buy it, deploy it and use it in production. And to answer support questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circling back to my first point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brocade hired &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbushong&#34;&gt;Michael Bushong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ask, why does that really matter? I assert that this indicates a very key element inside of Brocade: they know that they need to adapt and that they need a visionary to help direct that change. Bushong has a long history of enacting significant change. He is also a smart guy (see degree from UC Berkeley in advanced heat transfer &amp;amp; fluid dynamics). Bushong was responsible for the SDN group and the One Junos initiative at Juniper. He was also a key player at Plexxi, a very innovative networking company with a unique product. He knows how to motivate and promote change and has built a culture that is open to it. In fact, after the NFD9 presentation several of the team members approached a handful of us and asked us to elaborate on the things we were asking about and requesting. I have also received follow ups on those items. These things may seem insignificant, but give some serious thought to how often network vendors ask these questions, follow up and actually &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to needs and requirements that are non-standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that opinion aside, Brocade is also bringing good featues and really thinking about how to change and more importantly, improve, a key element in a sucessful company (see H.G Wells: &amp;ldquo;Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature&amp;rsquo;s inexorable imperative.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The NEC surprise</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-nec-surprise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 06:52:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-nec-surprise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&#34;http://necam.com/&#34;&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt; began talking about SDN at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day 9&lt;/a&gt;, I was not sure what to expect. I knew they had been heavily involved with openflow since the early days, and many years ago I was able to get my hands on their early OpenFlow controller and was immediately frustrated by its cryptic nature and frankly, poor documentation. Their switches were fine and were heavily utilized in early OpenFlow deployments. I knew they had decent support and were squarely on board the SDN train. Their controller, in 2010, was not terribly fun to work with. It was (if memory serves) prohibitively expensive and the support manual was nearly as cryptic as the controller. Because it&amp;rsquo;s my personality type, I went in with a very open mind, hoping to be surprised. After all, it&amp;rsquo;d been 4+ years since I&amp;rsquo;d seen that controller. Well, I am here to report that I will happily eat some crow. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eat-Crow.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eat-Crow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eat Crow&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   A few things became very apparent to me as I sat and watched the presentation from NEC, which you can view in its entirety below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEC is not messing around with their SDN offering. They&amp;rsquo;ve been in the openflow game since the beginning and the polish on their controller shows it. The topology is quite nice and they&amp;rsquo;ve got a finished looking product that would find itself at home in a decent sized NOC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEC is playing well with others. Their demo consisted of both NEC and DELL whitebox switches. To me this is an indication of both great forward thinking and a clear message that the controller is a product that can stand on its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEC is setting the barrier of entry low. Very low. They&amp;rsquo;ve got an entry level &amp;ldquo;SDN in a box&amp;rdquo; that consists of their controller and a few switches for like 3k. They&amp;rsquo;re also offering a 90 day free trial on their controller that is bundled with &lt;a href=&#34;http://mininet.org/&#34;&gt;mininet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like most other controllers, the NEC controller is topology aware and using openflow 1.3 for it&amp;rsquo;s communication. Unlike any other demo I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, NEC used CLI to make changes and displayed the updates in near realtime on the controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve got a tap product aimed at security tap aggregators a la &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gigamon.com/&#34;&gt;gigamon&lt;/a&gt;, so they&amp;rsquo;re seeing the value of SDN and openflow from a security lens as well as a network operations perspective, a good play in my opinion. SDN and openflow in particular have a great deal to offer the security community (think of all of the wacky stuff your security team has asked for and then map that into an openflow network. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably hit 80% match). NEC has done some tight integration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/dd448604.aspx&#34;&gt;microsoft hyper-v&lt;/a&gt; too, so environments leveraging hyper-v as a virtualization technology can drop this in to take advantage of the network programmability on top of their virtualization environment. This is something that I&amp;rsquo;d not seen before [although it may exist and I just don&amp;rsquo;t know it]. In addition, NEC has spun up an &amp;ldquo;app store&amp;rdquo; for SDN apps and allowed for some cross pollination, with a handful of caveats, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/&#34;&gt;opendaylight&lt;/a&gt; for testing. &lt;speculation&gt; There are a few things I find interesting about the NEC offering and about NEC in general. Being in a service provider environment off and on for most of my career, the fact that NEC is getting involved so heavily is intriguing. Unlike most of the other DC focused companies, NEC plays in the carrier market. While this particular briefing did not include any carrier updates, it would surprise me if this wasn&amp;rsquo;t being investigated behind some big doors. It makes sense to me and it would be a surprise if it did not occur to someone else. The SP market is fickle and slow to change, but ripe for fresh ideas. I see a lot of potential both there and in the DC / campus / enterprise. &lt;/speculation&gt;   &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/119508255&#34;&gt;Introduction to NEC Networking&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/sfoskett&#34;&gt;Stephen Foskett&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/119508725&#34;&gt;NEC ProgrammableFlow vCOps Solution&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/sfoskett&#34;&gt;Stephen Foskett&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/119510207&#34;&gt;ProgrammableFlow SCVMM Demo&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/sfoskett&#34;&gt;Stephen Foskett&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BigSwitch Networks BigCloud Fabric 2.5</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/bigswitch-networks-bigcloud-fabric-2-5/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 01:04:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/bigswitch-networks-bigcloud-fabric-2-5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigswitch.com&#34;&gt;BigSwitch&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigswitch.com/press-releases/2015/01/28/big-switch-networks-unveils-big-cloud-fabric-2_5?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvqTIZKXonjHpfsX56eQrUKS2lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ASMtrI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFQ7fBMbd4yLgIXRA%3D&#34;&gt;making waves again&lt;/a&gt;, this time with its Big Cloud Fabric product update. I was lucky enough to get a bit of a preview of what was coming and was pleasantly surprised by the new features, finding them functionally useful for both operators, security folks and management alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is the fabric fit to operate at hyper scale proportions, they&amp;rsquo;ve paid  close attention to making such operations even easier. With release 2.5 they&amp;rsquo;re focusing more on white box switches and abstracting the control plane further, which is important to note because decoupling those things can prove to be confusing and complicated and doing so can make operation and service clunky if not done well. From what &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/09/bigswitch-labs-for-sdn-learning-a-sneak-peek/&#34; title=&#34;BigSwitch Labs for SDN learning: a sneak peek!&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and experienced in their fabric cloud training&lt;/a&gt; and in this update, it appears smooth and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something mentioned during this briefing that I found particularly cool was the notion of a starter kits. BigSwitch is making available a &amp;ldquo;kickstarter&amp;rdquo; of their big cloud fabric with available software, hardware, cables and optics; a turnkey SDN platform in a box. Where I could see this being convenient is for those looking to build out a lab, dip their toe into the SDN / data center fabric world or to build out a dedicated project. A nice option for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BigSwitch is also adding support for VMWare VCenter and they&amp;rsquo;re also adding support for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/open-networking-switches/pd&#34;&gt;dell open network switch&lt;/a&gt; series to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really caught my eye, though, was the existence of a very robust looking set of analytics. An eye catching assortment of graphs, logs and functional data that is, get this, driven by an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elasticsearch.com&#34;&gt;elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; back end.   What is included is useful not only for Network and SDN engineers, but also for security &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bsw-eyecandy.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bsw-eyecandy.png&#34; alt=&#34;bsw-eyecandy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;professionals. Including things like event logs, fine grained search, canned reports for the execs and presenting everything via a REST API and a subset available via syslog for good measure I could see this being a very handy set of data for tracking down any number of things from incident response to problem resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing more from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigswitch.com&#34;&gt;BigSwitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll have the opportunity to participate in another &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/02/network-field-day-7/&#34; title=&#34;Network Field Day 7&#34;&gt; in the past&lt;/a&gt; and have done some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/network-field-day-5/&#34; title=&#34;Network Field Day 5 – Participate Remotely&#34;&gt;remote participation&lt;/a&gt; when possible, but like some of the other rare &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/scinet-a-privileged-few/&#34; title=&#34;SCinet, a privileged few&#34;&gt;opportunities&lt;/a&gt; I have had in my career, NFD is fairly unique in that it is constantly evolving in both the information provided and the individuals involved. As the saying goes, variety is the spice of life. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited about the presentations and have been looking forward to talking to a few of the participant companies for a while. There is a tight line up for NFD9, but I am very intrigued as I am either unfamiliar or have been looking for more information about several of them for quite some time now. &lt;a href=&#34;http://netbeez.net/&#34;&gt;NetBeez&lt;/a&gt; is  an interesting one, they provide a service not unlike a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with for years called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perfsonar.net/&#34;&gt;perfSonar&lt;/a&gt;. The data that these kind of projects provide is absolutely invaluable, so I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in NetBeez and how they&amp;rsquo;re accomplishing their tasks and presenting their data. I met with and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/04/blending-the-network-pluribus-serverswitch/&#34;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/&#34;&gt;Pluribus Networks&lt;/a&gt; at (and around the time of) &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;NFD7&lt;/a&gt;. I was impressed then and I&amp;rsquo;m impressed now. I see a great value in what they&amp;rsquo;re doing for so many practical applications and am very anxious to see what they&amp;rsquo;ve added, changed or tweaked since our last meeting roughly a year ago. &lt;a href=&#34;http://cumulusnetworks.com/&#34;&gt;Cumulus networks&lt;/a&gt; is another one I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to get lab time with since they came out. I am looking forward to having them in a room, they&amp;rsquo;re doing something to networking that, like Pluribus, is pretty unique and arguably game changing. At then end of the day, though, the best part of this is not that there are a few interesting topics, it is the fact that all of the topics and players are unique, top shelf and potentially game changing. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially an all star lineup (again) with the likes of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brocade.com&#34;&gt;Brocade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.solarwinds.com/&#34;&gt;Solarwinds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nec.com&#34;&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.velocloud.com/&#34;&gt;VeloCloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudgenix.com/&#34;&gt;Cloudgenix&lt;/a&gt;. This entire line up is right up my alley, as a large number of them are WAN or SDN oriented, which is where I spend the majority of my normal working days. In addition to all of that, I&amp;rsquo;ll finally get to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/networkingnerd&#34;&gt;NetworkingNerd&lt;/a&gt; in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenVswitch 2.3.0 RPMs</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/openvswitch-2-3-0-rpms/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2014 21:06:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/openvswitch-2-3-0-rpms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was wanting to do a few quick mock-ups with &lt;a href=&#34;http://openvswitch.org/&#34;&gt;OpenvSwitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/&#34;&gt;OpenDayLight&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to use CentOS since I have templates for it that I replicate.  Just like with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/11/openvswitch-2-0-debian-packages/&#34; title=&#34;OpenvSwitch 2.0 Debian packages&#34;&gt;debian stuff I had been doing&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find any in some quick searches.   I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://n40lab.wordpress.com/2014/09/04/openvswitch-2-3-0-lts-and-centos-7/&#34;&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt;, which had a great how to for building them, so I just used that.  Seeing as that the debian packages actually got downloaded a lot, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d post these RPMs as well.  They&amp;rsquo;re available &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/OVS2.0/OpenvSwitch-2.3.0-RPM.tgz&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and should work on CentOS 6.5 and probably 7. Just do a quick local install and start the service and you should be up and running.  &lt;code&gt;
yum localinstall /home/ovswitch/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86\_64/openvswitch-2.3.0-1.x86\_64.rpm 
sudo service openvswitch start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BigSwitch Labs for SDN learning: a sneak peek!</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/bigswitch-labs-for-sdn-learning-a-sneak-peek/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2014 10:24:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/bigswitch-labs-for-sdn-learning-a-sneak-peek/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently granted access to the beta &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigswitch.com/&#34;&gt;BigSwitch Networks&lt;/a&gt; lab site, a purpose built classroom in the cloud focused on teaching the BigSwitch SDN environment.  I had seen some of the BSN offerings in the past and always held them in high regard, but I was thoroughly impressed with both the completeness of the lab and how polished the controller environment was.&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-12-10.28.50.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot 2014-09-12 10.28.50&#34; /&gt; At the time of this writing, the lab consists of 3 modules: Building cloud fabric, monitoring fabric and dynamic provisioning of monitoring fabric.  Since there is quite a lot going on with this cloud based SDN classroom, for the scope of this post I&amp;rsquo;ll concentrate on the first, building cloud fabric.  I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the CLI*, and one thing that jumped right out to me was that they provide the GUI and the CLI, and that the CLI is familiar to anyone that has worked on an IOS device.  The lab is useful, even for someone that has done some SDN, both on production or in a lab, in that it presents the fundamentals in a way that both demonstrates the purpose and function and lays out the technology and product. From the technology presentation standpoint, the BigSwitch offering is quite impressive. The reality of it is that, in my experience, GUIs don&amp;rsquo;t always have the most intuitive or complete implementations and they&amp;rsquo;re hard to automate.  Now, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen to far the bigswitch offing is the exception to that rule.  The setup is very functional and goes through a range of great material. for comparison, below is the tenants display from the web interface: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-12-10.47.37.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-12-10.47.37.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot 2014-09-12 10.47.37&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   and the corresponding show command: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-12-10.33.49.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-12-10.33.49.png&#34; alt=&#34;show tenant&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nevertheless, part of my usual workflow is to use one to define the other when I can.  What I mean by that is that if I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how to accomplish my goal in the GUI, I switch to the CLI and see what I can do from there, returning to the GUI to see what has changed and then reverse engineer it from that perspective.  The opposite is also true, I have used the CLI to define the GUI &lt;em&gt;:cough:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/security/netscreen/&#34;&gt;netscreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;:cough:&lt;/em&gt;. The important thing to note here, though, is that the tools all work as if it is a real environment, because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a real environment. The god among men here, really, is the &lt;em&gt;debug rest&lt;/em&gt; command.  This command, when issued in the CLI (displayed below) allows the commands sent to the terminal to automatically pop up with the rest interface commands necessary to utilize them.  Wrap your head around that one for a minute.  Are you thinking automation?  Me too; seeing that made me want to go write code, and I am a horrible developer. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-12-10.50.19.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot 2014-09-12 10.50.19&#34; /&gt; In the time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent within this system I have been thoroughly impressed with how well it functioned.  I had no issues whatsoever with how the training presented the material, executed the commands or displayed the responses.  My only suggestion would be to add a configuration guide for the CLI =) Below is a quick youtube video of some of the functions.    * Yes, I know SDN is supposed to &amp;ldquo;kill the CLI&amp;rdquo;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t by the sensationalism for the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you don&#39;t need a firewall [how to secure an open perimeter network]</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/why-you-dont-need-a-firewall-how-to-secure-an-open-perimeter-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 07:30:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/why-you-dont-need-a-firewall-how-to-secure-an-open-perimeter-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I admit that the title was meant to be inflammatory.  However, there are use cases that aren&amp;rsquo;t terribly uncommon where an in-line security appliance is just not the correct tool for the job.  Someone once told me &amp;ldquo;a firewall protects a network like a fuse protects an electrical circuit&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a correct statement. Firewall vendors will probably argue this and enterprise folks may discount this as heresy and call for burning me at the stake.  I can say, though, that the use of a firewall, IPS or other inline security appliance has presented many problems in many environments in my years as a network and security engineer and architect.    To that end, there are mechanisms for replacing the functions of a firewall and IPS with other options, which in many cases have a lower capital expense [although they may have a higher &lt;em&gt;initial&lt;/em&gt; operational expense].  I&amp;rsquo;ll outline them here, but before I do I want to re-iterate that NAT (PAT) is not a security tool, it&amp;rsquo;s a translation tool.  Nothing more.  So, I will leave that out.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t have appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 address space some of these things may need adjustments although they are still accomplishable by doing NAT on a border Layer 3 device.     Below is a talk that I gave at BroCon14 that is a rough outline of how to do this, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend 30 minutes listening to me talk about it, the clifs notes are bulleted below, but the context is all in the video so I encourage you to watch it before responding to my post. For those that want to take a look, here is the talk. Here are the bullets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Announce only necessary resources &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can utilize routing to only expose the pieces of the network that need to be exposed.  If you have a /16 and on;y a /24 needs to be exposed, only announce that prefix.  This is not that different than a typical DMZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter access to network, storage and management hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilize best practice ingress filtering.  Follow &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38&#34;&gt;BCP38&lt;/a&gt;. You should be doing this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilize host based firewalls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a no-brainer.  Firewall as close to the resource as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employ central host management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your life easy.  Cloud providers do it and it&amp;rsquo;s well documented nowadays.  There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://cfengine.com/&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://puppetlabs.com/&#34;&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralize logging and flow data collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another no brainer, you should be doing this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create baselines for traffic and activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is good.  Knowledge is power.  Baselines are useful for both anomaly detection and forecasting and it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy and tune IDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive IDS system[s] off of a TAP or SPAN are key to this kind of architecture.  See video for more details but there are a bunch of good options. I prefer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bro.org&#34;&gt;Bro IDS&lt;/a&gt; but there are many players both commercial and FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter with black hole routing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/10/black-hole-routing/&#34; title=&#34;Black Hole routing&#34;&gt;talked about this before&lt;/a&gt;.  Automating this is key to making it function efficiently and it is a fantastic tool.  This can be done with BGP (traditionally) or with something innovative like OpenFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make use of regularly scheduled external vulnerability scanning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to verify your exposure and works for any sized network.  Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Clearly this isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone, and that&amp;rsquo;s ok.  For anyone that has struggled with issues involving security appliances either based on protocol, horsepower or interface speeds, there are options.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crystal Ball: Cisco buying tail-f.  What does it mean?</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/crystal-ball-cisco-buying-tail-f-what-does-it-mean/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 16:24:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/crystal-ball-cisco-buying-tail-f-what-does-it-mean/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tail-f.com/cisco-announces-intent-acquire-tail-f-acquisition-advances-ciscos-cloud-virtualization-portfolio-industry-leading-network-service-orchestration-technology/&#34;&gt;announcement of Cisco Systems intent to purchase tail-f&lt;/a&gt;, proponents of a multi-vendor environment are waiting with baited breath to see how the networking giant will deal with support of competitor hardware and CLIs. Yang is here to stay, there is no doubt about that. As is netconf. Both of these are good things for the industry as a whole, having a standard way to communicate with network hardware [&lt;a href=&#34;http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/opinion/OpenFlow-as-a-network-control-protocol-goes-deeper-than-data-center&#34;&gt;that isn&amp;rsquo;t openflow&lt;/a&gt;] is necessary and immeasurably useful. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the politics, the internal technical bits or even the details of who stays and who goes. Smarter folks than me have &lt;a href=&#34;http://lamejournal.com/2014/06/18/thoughts-cisco-acquiring-tail-f-systems/#more-2999&#34;&gt;already done that&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I want to think about what this means for operators, architects and engineers when looking for a management platform. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/02/tail-f-ncs-upsetting-network-management-in-a-good-way/&#34; title=&#34;Tail-F NCS: upsetting network management…in a good way.&#34;&gt;before about how Tail-f was a Rosetta Stone&lt;/a&gt; for networking equipment. With the Cisco acquisition looming, this potentially and very likely changes this and there now exists a gaping hole in this type of management system. So, what does that mean? If I had to guess, I&amp;rsquo;d say that even though Cisco has been a bit more friendly in the opensource world, it makes absolutely no sense for them to support a platform that allows for the use of any network platform. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m being cynical, but I doubt it. What this does is leave the majority of us looking for a cross vendor management solution, where the tail&amp;ndash;f NCS lives, out in the cold. However, there is a silver lining. The cup is half full in the forwarding plane today. My hopes is that the lack of a real commercial product that does what NCS does, and the awareness raised that such a product existed in the first place will kick start the FOSS world into building something. Only since RANCID have I seen a really viable option for cross platform management [and in the case of RANCID management=change and configuration tracking]. This also opens the door for an existing management protocol ::cough:: openflow ::cough:: to emerge as a really viable management and control protocol and mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hopefully there are some things here that will make you really upset in a very good way”&lt;/em&gt; is how &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cmoberg&#34;&gt;Carl Moberg&lt;/a&gt; of Swedish based company &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tail-f.com/&#34;&gt;tail-f&lt;/a&gt; opened up to the crowd at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;Networking Field Day 7&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/tail-f-systems-presents-at-networking-field-day-7/&#34;&gt;Feb 19, 2014&lt;/a&gt;.  Tail-f is a sleeper, I had actually never heard of them before NFD7, but they&amp;rsquo;ve got a very unique product in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tail-f.com/network-control-system/&#34;&gt;NCS&lt;/a&gt; and in my opinion it can change the way existing &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; future networks are managed.  Right now.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a platform that is green, unpolished or unfinished.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tail-f.com/network-control-system/&#34;&gt;NCS&lt;/a&gt; is in the ring and it brought its A-game.   Their site describes it better than I ever could: _&amp;ldquo;Tail-f Network Control System, or NCS, enables network operators to manage all of their services and network devices with a single tool.&amp;ldquo; _A bold statement, and I tend to be pretty skeptical of such statements. However, I was really intrigued by the NCS platform and as I discovered, it is not hype. Watching the demo of this got my brain racing, it was exciting to think about all of the things it could simplify; I was excited about networking.  So many things In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m really just going to scratch the surface of what this software toolkit can tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;any-network-of-of-ambitious-size-that-needs-to-get-people-out-of-the-loop&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any network of of ambitious size that needs to get people out of the loop”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CTO says that NCS is for &amp;ldquo;_Any network of of ambitious size that needs to get people out of the loop_”, and I tend to agree, which is what makes this so powerful. In a world of openflow this and sdn that, most of which is still under heavy development, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think of NCS as a &amp;ldquo;rosetta stone&amp;rdquo; of network management tools. It’s a controller, but in a different way. Its not openflow, but it knows openflow, so it is looking forward, but it also supports everything that is already there, an absolute necessity for 95% of networks that are not greenfield. From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tail-f.com/network-control-system/#which-types-of&#34;&gt;NCS FAQ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rose-lg-http-www-forwardingplane-net-wp-content-uploads-2014-02-rose-lg-jpg-http-www-forwardingplane-net-wp-content-uploads-2014-02-rose-lg-jpg-any-device-that-can-be-remotely-configured-can-be-managed-by-ncs-this-includes-routers-switches-load-balancers-firewalls-web-servers-and-a-whole-host-of-other-devices-both-virtual-and-physical-since-it-is-not-limited-to-one-type-of-device-or-particular-vendor-ncs-allows-for-management-of-the-entire-network-from-a-single-pane-of-glass&#34;&gt;_&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rose_lg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rose_lg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rose_lg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any device that can be remotely configured can be managed by NCS. This includes, routers, switches, load-balancers, firewalls, web servers and a whole host of other devices (both virtual and physical). Since it is not limited to one type of device or particular vendor, NCS allows for management of the entire network from a single pane of glass.&amp;rdquo;_&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets face it, network management is not exactly easy to do in a sane and robust way, there are always quirks, one-offs and proprietary goo. That&amp;rsquo;s probably never going to change.  From the open source to the commercial, I&amp;rsquo;ve used, evaluated or extended a wide swath of them in my time in the industry, and this one really shocked me in what it was able to do in such a demonstrably elegant way, which we all know is not an easy task since we all have odd, uncommon or sometimes unreasonable requirements. A few things are really compelling about NCS.  First, it&amp;rsquo;s all &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YANG&#34;&gt;YANG&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it is an established standard for doing exactly this and it can be referenced by any number of protocols for obtaining or setting the desired data or parameters.  This also means that it can very quickly and easily be extended to support new products, software loads, communications mechanisms and features. Tail-F changed the way I was thinking about network management.  They&amp;rsquo;ve taken the religion out of equipment vendors, because you can choose how to interact with them.  They allow for management of a myriad of platforms from an operator-chosen, familiar CLI.  Have guys that like JunOS?  Great, no problem.  Team members that prefer IOS?  No worries.  They can manage the Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade, Extreme Networks or one of the many other CLI variants from their choice of IOS or JunOS-like command sets.   No longer is it important to understand a particular CLI.  I wish I could have had access to this product 5 years ago when, at a previous job, we introduced JunOS to a team that had been working on IOS and Foundry for the majority of their careers.  It would have solved so many issues and driven the learning curve to nil. The CLI translator is really just the icing.  The configuration validation is immensely powerful and I could easily see it preventing many typos and misconfigurations (you know you&amp;rsquo;ve done it, we all have).  It can also provide compliance reporting, service management and configuration reconciliation, all of which are generally in-house written tools or manually accmplished tasks in my experience. Standardize and deploy ACLs across a range of platforms in geographically diverse areas, provision BGP policy on huge numbers of peers very quickly, reconcile MTUs on interfaces of devices that have been neglected, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/ML2/Tail-f-NCS-neutron-ml2-driver&#34;&gt;interface with OpenStack Neutron&lt;/a&gt;.  The use cases are pretty open ended, really. Anything that needs to be done at scale can be, and it can be error checked in the process. Don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it, I&amp;rsquo;m clearly excited about it and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get my hands on it.  Watch the NCS demo: Tail-f Systems NCS Demo at Networking Field Day 7   All of the videos can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/tail-f-systems-presents-at-networking-field-day-7/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I got an email asking me to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day 7&lt;/a&gt;.  I was very happy and humbled to get asked again since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;NFD5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/&#34;&gt;NFD6&lt;/a&gt; for various reasons outside of my control (although I did try to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/network-field-day-5/&#34; title=&#34;Network Field Day 5 – Participate Remotely&#34;&gt;participate with NFD5  remotely&lt;/a&gt;).   If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/&#34;&gt;tech field day&lt;/a&gt; series, you should spend a little time and learn about the value it brings.  There are archived video feeds of &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/timing/past/&#34;&gt;previous conferences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;live feed&lt;/a&gt; and social media outlets for current field days. To be included in such an event is an amazing experience in and of itself, but to be included with a technical group like this is pretty humbling.  This NFD includes the likes of &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//bob-mccouch/&#34;&gt;Bob McCouch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/brandon-carroll/&#34;&gt;Brandon Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/chris-marget/&#34;&gt;Chris Marget&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//edward-henry/&#34;&gt;Edward Henry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//ethan-banks/&#34;&gt;Ethan Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/rich-brambley/chris-evans/greg-ferro/&#34;&gt;Greg Ferro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//john-herbert/&#34;&gt;John Herbert&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/josh-obrien/&#34;&gt;Josh O&amp;rsquo;Brien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/matt-oswalt/&#34;&gt;Matt Oswalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//paul-stewart/&#34;&gt;Paul Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/teren-bryson/&#34;&gt;Teren Bryson&lt;/a&gt;.  All very competent and forward thinking folks in the networking and IT fields.  If this isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to get you interested in the value of this event, let me tell you about the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenvSwitch 2.0 Debian packages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a larger fun project I&amp;rsquo;m working on (OVS for the ALIX platform; more to come on that once I have it 100% working), I have been playing a lot with &lt;a href=&#34;http://openvswitch.org/&#34;&gt;OVS&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great platform, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/install-open-vswitch-v2-redhat-fedora-19/&#34;&gt;as others have mentioned&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s as close to an SDN reference data plane implementation as we have.  I&amp;rsquo;d be surprised if many if not all commercial implementations of OpenFlow aren&amp;rsquo;t based on OVS.  Anyway, I wanted to build debian packages since I&amp;rsquo;d never done it before and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun.  I wanted to use OVS2 so that I can play with some of the newer features and specifically to see how well the IPv6 support is in 2.0 when paired with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/&#34;&gt;OpenDaylight&lt;/a&gt;(more to come on this, too. I promise =). This proved to be more simple than I anticipated mostly due to lots of good documentation.  To accomplish it, I decided to start with a VM since I lie to work in virtualized environments for experimentation and lambing. I spun up a Debian 7 VM from scratch and began configuring it as I usually do with the inclusion of the tools necessary to build packages. _** I originally tried this from the git repo via _git clone git://openvswitch.org/openvswitch&lt;em&gt; but kept seeing weird errors so I moved to the 2.0.0 tarball.  &lt;/em&gt;```

      <title>Basic reference openflow controller VMs running in CentOS 6 for KVM.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/basic-reference-openflow-controller-vms-running-in-centos-6-for-kvm/</link>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/basic-reference-openflow-controller-vms-running-in-centos-6-for-kvm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been working, off and on, on a how-to for building the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/&#34;&gt;daylight openflow controller&lt;/a&gt; under CentOS.  Most openflow docs and dev are done under ubuntu or debian, and while those are both fantastic alternatives, there are a huge number of folks that will want or need to use RHEL or CentOS. So, seeing as that is the case, having someone be mindful of that is important.  When I saw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/installing-opendaylight-on-centos/&#34;&gt;write up&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blinken_lichten&#34;&gt;Jon Langemak&lt;/a&gt;, I scrapped my attempt at a how-to since his was so much better. If you&amp;rsquo;re not following Jon and reading his blog, you should be.  He&amp;rsquo;s a sharp guy with interesting things to say. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/projectfloodlight-logo-header.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/projectfloodlight-logo-header.png&#34; alt=&#34;projectfloodlight-logo-header&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That got me thinking about references and resources, and I decided that I would take a few of the things I had been working on on my home lab and make them available to the masses.  I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of importable base VMs.  So, seeing that I am working on testing openflow controllers, it made sense in my [constantly racing] mind to make the reference, base level VMs available.  If anyone is interested in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/&#34;&gt;floodlight controller&lt;/a&gt; running under CentOS 6.3 built using the method documented &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/02/building-a-floodlight-openflow-controller-on-centos-6/&#34; title=&#34;Building a Floodlight OpenFlow controller on CentOS 6&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, a KVM image is now available to download from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/vm-images/centos-floodlight-template.tbz&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It is, as stated, a KVM image, created by using the method I documented in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/centos-kvm-install-quick-start-to-a-vm/&#34; title=&#34;CentOS KVM Install – Quick Start to a VM&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago.    There is a readme file in the archive wth basic instructions.  You&amp;rsquo;ll need a basic understanding of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page&#34;&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt; to make it work, or you can try to convert it to something else like vmware, XEN or virtualbox. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding one of these soon for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/&#34;&gt;daylight&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenFlow Hybrid.  It&#39;s a must, not an option.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/openflow-hybrid-its-a-must-not-an-option/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 16:17:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/openflow-hybrid-its-a-must-not-an-option/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenFlow is, of course, a hot buzzword.  It&amp;rsquo;s the newest, and in my opinion, the most innovative thing to hit data networking since dynamic routing.  The ability to programmatically, systematically and potentially dynamically control traffic at the flow level through a network is innovative, exciting and terrifying [to many network engineers and architects] at the same time.  Allowing applications to touch the network change behavior is something that many engineers are not terribly comfortable with.  I will even admit that a few years ago I was pretty tentative about software changing network hardware.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/10/black-hole-routing/&#34; title=&#34;Black Hole routing&#34;&gt;Building a Blackhole router&lt;/a&gt; was an easy way for me to acquaint myself with this and get comfortable with software changing things without human interaction.   Most of my discomfort with this process was the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m not a good developer.  I can hack scripts and read most basic code in Shell, C, Perl, Python and Ruby but I don&amp;rsquo;t actively do anything but an occasional script or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/vdxrancid-contrib-scripts/&#34; title=&#34;VDXrancid contrib scripts&#34;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/06/alurancid-and-pfrancid/&#34; title=&#34;alurancid and pfrancid&#34;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/12/alcatel-lucent-rancid-scripts/&#34; title=&#34;Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts&#34;&gt;existing projects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Enterprise-Network.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Enterprise-Network-265x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Enterprise Network&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conversely, we&amp;rsquo;re all pretty comfortable with networks as they exist today.  The typical &amp;ldquo;enterprise pyramid&amp;rdquo; is best practice and works very well.  Good physical design is good physical design.  However, where this, and any other network gets hairy is when it scales to hyper scale or the operations team is thin. Here is where things get interesting.  Call it what you want, SDN is changing the way we as networking professionals think about this support model.  Remember managing fat wireless access points?  It became unruly and impossible at scale and once wireless ceased to be a convenience network it was nearly impossible.  Enter wireless controllers and thin access points.  5-7 years later this is now the standard.  The differences, though, is that wireless was still a relatively small footprint comparatively speaking and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a critical infrastructure before those changes had to happen. The problem that we face now is that we have critical infrastructure and legacy support mechanisms.  It is unreasonable to think that we&amp;rsquo;ll be ripping out a traditional, functional network and replacing it with a greenfield OpenFlow network, regardless of what the researchers and heavy proponents think.  Just like with the transitional mechanisms used in IPv6 deployments, there needs to be a transitional period where both traditional and OpenFlow networks can coexist.  There are a few options for this, but this is a problem that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/hybrid-openflow-using-the-normal-action/&#34;&gt;OFPP Normal action&lt;/a&gt; can potentially solve.     &lt;a href=&#34;https://openflow.stanford.edu/static/openflowj/releases/1.0.1/apidocs/org/openflow/protocol/OFPort.html#OFPP_NORMAL&#34;&gt;OFPP Normal&lt;/a&gt; will send a packet in the openflow pipeline to the native switching mechanisms for traditional forwarding, much like having a default route in an IGP handles anything without a more specific route. Based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openflow.org/documents/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf&#34;&gt;OpenFlow 1.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, an OpenFlow enabled switch is not required to support all actions, &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; support the NORMAL action.  I am here to say that my opinion is that this is something that has to happen.  It&amp;rsquo;s is reasonable to say that my understanding of OpenFlow is still evolving, but building networks is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for 15 years.  Green fielding a totally OpenFlow network is almost certainly not going to happen in 95% of cases.  Backwards compatibility with existing networking is going to have to happen. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tantrum.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tantrum.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tantrum&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As a case study, lets look at the adoption of IPv6.  We actually *need* IPv6.  Has adoption been smooth?  No.  Entities have been dragged into it kicking and screaming and tightly holding on to mechanisms like NAT as a way to delay the inevitable.  I could go on forever about how enterprises, service providers and any other network has caused more harm, pain and unnecessary expense than good by delaying IPv6 over and over&amp;hellip;.but I digress. We [mostly] don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; OpenFlow yet.  Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s useful.  Yes, it has use cases that make a lot of sense.  Making it easy (read: painless) is the key to deployment.   My first reaction is that hybrid mode is the way to do this.  If your vendor doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a hybrid strategy, make them aware that they need one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daylight, a new dawn is approaching.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/daylight-a-new-dawn-is-approaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2013 04:25:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/daylight-a-new-dawn-is-approaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The SDN world is abuzz with the announcement that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org&#34;&gt;OpenDaylight controller&lt;/a&gt; came from stealth mode today.  Why is this important?  Well, SDN and OpenFlow are fractured.  It is Mac vs. PC, Beta vs VHS, Coke vs. Pepsi all over again&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;multiplied by 100x and with a handful of players. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/logo_opendaylight.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/logo_opendaylight.png&#34; alt=&#34;logo_opendaylight&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Vendor zealots and brand loyalists will nearly always side with their camp.  Heck, even I have some biases of personal preference.  But at the end of the day, the greater good is always most important.  This is why I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic about the daylight project.  From their about page: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;At this early stage of SDN adoption, the industry acknowledges the benefits of establishing an open, reference framework for programmability and control through an open source SDN solution. Such a framework maintains the flexibility and choice to allow organizations to deploy SDN as they please, yet still mitigates many of the risks of adopting early stage technologies and integrating with existing infrastructure investments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I find this refreshing.  I understand that there will be a bit of the &amp;ldquo;NDA this&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;closed that&amp;rdquo;.  These are new grounds being forged.  Vendors and humans in general don&amp;rsquo;t like to feel like they are giving away the farm and leaping into the fire. I tend to, personally, have a bit of the &amp;ldquo;jump and hope I have a parachute on&amp;rdquo; attitude.  I&amp;rsquo;m not risk averse and the thrill of the possibility of failure invigorates me.  That, obviously, is not how billion dollar companies think.  This is why the who&amp;rsquo;s who of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/project/members&#34;&gt;Daylight members&lt;/a&gt; is so encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bigswitch&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Collaboration_logo_V2.svg/607px-Collaboration_logo_V2.svg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brocade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juniper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ericsson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IBM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redhat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NEC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMWare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arista&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fujutsu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plumgrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at that list.  Now look again.  There are names on there that I never would have expected. This project is associated with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linuxfoundation.org&#34;&gt;the linux foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that has a core value of &amp;ldquo;Providing Neutral Collaboration and Education&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;  several names on this list are almost never associated with &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo;, Neutral&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Transparent&amp;rdquo;. This list and the implications of it by themselves are enough to raise heads, eyebrows and to potentially levitate &lt;a href=&#34;http://ghostbusters.wikia.com/wiki/Dana_Barrett&#34;&gt;Dana Barrett&lt;/a&gt; four feet above her covers. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/levitate-dana.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;levitate-dana&#34; /&gt; Another double take piece of informationis that the project core components are based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/announcements/2013/04/industry-leaders-collaborate-opendaylight-project-donate-key-technologies&#34;&gt;Cisco OnePK&lt;/a&gt;.  The fact that the core is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/iosswrel/onepk.html&#34;&gt;Cisco OnePK&lt;/a&gt; is certainly interesting, but the real gem of this is that there is potential collaboration and, more importantly, competition [and innovation] for an SDN controller and networking industry recognition that this &amp;ldquo;software defined networking revolution&amp;rdquo; is happening. Just like any complicated relationship there will be problems, posturing, compromise and impasses.  My thoughts are that the outcome of whatever daylight becomes or doesn&amp;rsquo;t is actually irrelevant.  There is now a far more powerful and encompassing movement happening.  ASIC companies are on board. The Linux foundation is involved.  Flexibility is implied.  Community involvement is encouraged.  Mountains are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My SDN soapbox (now with IPv6!)</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2013 21:45:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week there was a lot of buzz about SDN (as usual). There was a&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightreading.com/blog/software-defined-networking/sdns-killer-app-more-network-control/240151376&#34;&gt; lightreading thread that I commented on&lt;/a&gt; and a fantastic read by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/networkstatic&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/be-the-steamroller-not-the-road/&#34;&gt;being the steamroller and not the road&lt;/a&gt; that got me thinking about OpenFlow and SDN in a way I had not before. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fearofchange.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fearofchange.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fearofchange&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;soapbox&gt; All that is old is new again. I remember when internal networks were small and routing protocols were taboo in many internal environments. RIP (AKA routing by rumor) was about as innovative as we got, OSPF was &amp;ldquo;too complex&amp;rdquo; and was &amp;ldquo;software changing the network topology&amp;rdquo;, according to some folks I worked with in what seems like a lifetime ago. Clearly they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the entire picture and were clouded by FUD. Now using a link state protocol is a standard and one would probably not consider building a complex, production layer 3 network without an IGP like ISIS or OSPFv[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (or even EIGRP&amp;hellip;I guess). This is simple evolution and progression. The more folks try to resist, the further behind they&amp;rsquo;ll be left. SDN and OpenFlow are not unlike IPv6 in many ways when viewed from a technology implementation perspective, and in fact, we can probably learn from the resistance to IPv6 to help us with the acceptance of SDN and OpenFlow. V6 has been coming for years. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; here. Backbones have been running it for a very long time and we actually &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; it on the client side to account for the huge number of hosts now connecting to the public Internet. Many entities, especially very risk averse enterprises, are struggling to resist it (IPv6) and hold onto NAT and IPv4 as long as possible.  While this will almost certainly buy them a handful of years, it&amp;rsquo;s futile.  Translation and transition tech geared toward the folks that refuse to adapt will allow them to grasp onto legacy methodologies for a bit longer, but as the Borg say, &amp;ldquo;resistance is futile&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Borg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Borg-300x274.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Borg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These same things are all going to happen with SDN. What we say is &amp;ldquo;OpenFlow is simply an open protocol for creating flow based forwarding.  It allows for the inclusion of other factors such as Layer4 to make those decisions more tunable and granular.&amp;rdquo; What skeptics hear is &amp;ldquo;There is a hole in the boat, we&amp;rsquo;re all going to die&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Network Engineers are all going to be out of a job!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;your job is going to be replaced by software&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;software and applications will make the way we think about and do everything obsolete&amp;rdquo;, all of which translate to &amp;ldquo;dramatic and drastic change&amp;rdquo;. Most of this is just sensationalism and FUD. In my opinion, though, it is all based in truth .  It may be &amp;ldquo;drastic&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s not dramatic.  It&amp;rsquo;s natural evolution.  It will happen slowly.  We will have to change they way we do things. The proven fact we as networking and security professionals need to remember is that change going to happen with or without SDN, it&amp;rsquo;s the nature of an innovative field like technology to change.  None of us would be doing what we do without being inquisitive enough to figure out problems, challenge norms and shift thinking. SDN, just like IPv6, is happening.  Personally I&amp;rsquo;d rather be knowledgeable about as opposed to in the dark and scrambling to learn about them at the 11th hour. &lt;/soapbox&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Network Field Day 5 - Participate Remotely</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-5/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 14:59:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;Networking Field Day&lt;/a&gt; was something that I&amp;rsquo;d heard of but wasn&amp;rsquo;t really aware of what is really was.  I occasionally looked at Twitter and saw the hash tags but did not know much about how it was set up or what it was about.  In fact, I actually thought it was supposed to be like the HAM radio field day stuff where you go out and build out an emergency network on the fly.  OK, I should have done more homework, admittedly. Fast forward 6 months. I&amp;rsquo;m working more and more with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkstatic.com&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; on day job stuff and he&amp;rsquo;s encouraging me to brush the dust off of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net&#34;&gt;old blog&lt;/a&gt; (which became this site). I&amp;rsquo;m working more on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/02/building-a-floodlight-openflow-controller-on-centos-6/&#34; title=&#34;Building a Floodlight OpenFlow controller on CentOS 6&#34;&gt;OpenFlow&lt;/a&gt;,  virtualization stuff like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/centos-kvm-install-quick-start-to-a-vm/&#34; title=&#34;CentOS KVM Install – Quick Start to a VM&#34;&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/01/headless-virtualbox-host-on-centos/&#34; title=&#34;Headless VirtualBox host on CentOS&#34;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; and bringing up 100G WAN links.  I even had the extremely cool opportunity to do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetpushers.net/show-131-golf-cart-in-my-fibre-tunnel/&#34;&gt;Packet Pushers Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these things are a direct result of becoming more engaged in the larger community, a networking community I had pretty much carved myself out of back in 2002 when I left the service provider world for R&amp;amp;E.  This self isolation was a bit of an oversight on my part. What I did not realize was that, as someone in R&amp;amp;E, I had a unique perspective on some of the industry products and direction and was often seeing things a lot sooner than the general enterprise world. As I got more and more engaged I realized that there were a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of great folks out there that like to collaborate, share and write about their professional experiences in our field of choice.  These same people were doing innovative and interesting things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;NFD&lt;/a&gt; was one of those things.  So, I started to write down more of the things I was thinking and doing.  I figured that at least someone would find them useful or interesting or at least fodder for solving insomnia.  When I was asked to participate and come out to NFD5, I was both ecstatic and humbled at the same time.  This was the place where the networking industry thought leaders go to convene and discuss directionality as well as current networking technologies. Just to relay the scale and scope of the folks involved, here is the list of delegates for NFD5:  &lt;/p&gt;

The list of vendor participants is also deep.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juniper.net&#34;&gt;Juniper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruckuswireless.com&#34;&gt;Ruckus Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;www.plexxi.com/&#34;&gt;Plexxi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;www.brocade.com/&#34;&gt;Brocade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.solarwinds.com&#34;&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; are all on the docket. Unfortunately for me, I was not able to attend due to work scheduling and coordination of family stuff, something I truly lament.  To think that I was even considered to be on that list is truly humbling and something I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. Not being able to attend, I wanted to participate as much as I could, so I started looking around and talking to folks and found the link to the live feed as well as the Twitter hashtag. It seems like a good idea to put this out there to as many folks as possible to not only bring attention to the fact that this is happening, but that you can participate from wherever you are.  I would encourage anyone who reads this and is interested in Networking as a profession, or is already in our industry, to pay attention to the Tech Field Day events.  Watch the live stream.  Ask questions and make comments on Twitter via the hashtag &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFD5&#34;&gt;#NFD5&lt;/a&gt;.  Get involved. During the event you should be able to do a live stream from right inside this post or from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;NFD5 page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Floodlight OpenFlow controller on CentOS 6</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-a-floodlight-openflow-controller-on-centos-6/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2013 13:10:24 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-a-floodlight-openflow-controller-on-centos-6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit of back history: I came from BSD land. I was a FreeBSD user from way back in the 1990s. BSD land is a land of secure boxes and very high uptimes. It&amp;rsquo;s also a land of arguably clunky package support, a lot of compiling by hand and these days, not nearly as encompassing package and network tuning support. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/06/better-support-for-linux-and-annoyed-about-it/ &amp;quot;Better support for Linux (and annoyed about it&#34;&gt;I decided to move to Linux&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;) a while ago, reluctantly, and chose Debian as my flavor of choice. I do love debian, however, I very quiuckly realized that even debian is a bit of a fringe OS build of Linux. Commercial support is nearly all based on RHEL. Folks that run RHEL also run CentOS. We run both in my day job. About a year ago to I, once again, decided I needed to learn CentOS. There are a lot of posts about building floodlight as an openflow controller. I used this tutorial &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/floodlight-openflow-controller-gui-applet/&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury did&lt;/a&gt; to build mine. There is a good one on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://floodlight.openflowhub.org/getting-started/&#34;&gt;openflow hub&lt;/a&gt; site as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that many are based on Debian or Ubuntu, which can be subtly different than a CentOS / RHEL experience.   In CentOS, log in and sudo -s or su to root. Install the prereqs: &lt;em&gt;yum -y install build-essential default-jdk ant python-dev eclipse git&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;mkdir /services/floodlight&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cd /services/floodlight/&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;git clone git://github.com/floodlight/floodlight.git ant&lt;/em&gt; Start floodlight in the background. &lt;em&gt;./floodlight.sh &amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt; Because I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at looking at directions, I went to the base URL. This will yield an error that looks something like this: &lt;em&gt;{&amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo;:&amp;ldquo;Not Found&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo;:true,&amp;ldquo;throwable&amp;rdquo;:null,&amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo;:&amp;ldquo;The server has not found anything matching the request URI&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;:false,&amp;ldquo;informational&amp;rdquo;:false,&amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;:404,&amp;ldquo;reasonPhrase&amp;rdquo;:&amp;ldquo;Not Found&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;uri&amp;rdquo;:&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serverError&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;connectorError&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;clientError&amp;quot;:true,&amp;quot;globalError&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;redirection&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;recoverableError&amp;quot;:false&#34;&gt;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serverError&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;connectorError&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;clientError&amp;quot;:true,&amp;quot;globalError&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;redirection&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;recoverableError&amp;quot;:false&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/em&gt; The right way to access floodlight is to use the entire URL: http://&lt;address&gt;:8080/ui/index.html Learn from my stupidity.   Here is a script to build it for you:```
#!/bin/bash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;echo &amp;ldquo;Installing prerequisits:&amp;rdquo;
yum -y install build-essential default-jdk ant python-dev eclipse git&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;echo &amp;ldquo;Installing floodlight to /services/floodight/&amp;rdquo;
mkdir /services/floodlight
cd /services/floodlight/
git clone git://github.com/floodlight/floodlight.git
ant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;echo &amp;ldquo;Starting floodlight:&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SDN Across the WAN, part deux.  Primitives.</title>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-the-wan-part-deux-primitives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34; title=&#34;SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look&#34;&gt;lamenting about the SDN WAN&lt;/a&gt; options for a while now.  Having SDN/OpenFlow in a data center or campus is relatively well documented and already widely deployed.  Google has been doing SDN across their private WAN in production.  These pieces are easy.  What isn&amp;rsquo;t easy is the ability to plumb SDN across many domains that are under disparate control.   This part is hard. What is lacking is a fundamental framework, or set of primitives to build from.  As an example, how does one build a SDN path across this:   &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;SDN Reference Architecture -Sanitized&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First I think we need to define what we want out of the SDN path.  A reserved bandwidth allocation?  A Layer2 path?  Flow instantiation across the entire path?  The first two have a least common denominator.  The third is hard, especially if the path transits a segment with no SDN capability. This piece is making my brain hurt.  There seems to be a lot of early work on this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.internet2.edu/speakers/speakers.php?go=people&amp;amp;id=2865&#34;&gt;Inder Monga&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net&#34;&gt;ESnet&lt;/a&gt; has been working at making this happen, and I think he&amp;rsquo;s the closest from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my searching and researching.   I want to know how to do this across &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; networks.   I want to see the future of carrier WAN connectivity, to taste the unicorn milk. The methodology so far has been to break this down into small black boxes.  After doing that, I realized that there is going to have to be a common protocol.  The least common denominator to all of this is the SDN.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t much matter what that SDN is as long as there is a central controller.  It can be OpenFlow, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/&#34;&gt;OSCARS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Multi-Protocol_Label_Switching&#34;&gt;GMPLS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ext.delaat.net/olex/index.html&#34;&gt;Open LightPath Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, whatever.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.  They all need a controller.  Within those controllers there needs to be &amp;ldquo;an energy field created by all SDN. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together&amp;rdquo;.  Yes, I like Star Wars. So, how would one do this?  It would be ideal, to me at least, if there was a standard set of protocols that all of these controllers could speak.  This standard communication could be as simple as how a BGP peering functions.  Site A has a controller, it &amp;ldquo;peers&amp;rdquo; with it&amp;rsquo;s upstream and announces its capabilities. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;SDN peering&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All of these peers exchange capability information and pass it on with a standardized set of language and a location identifier (think ASN and route announcements).  To me this appears to be the lowest hanging fruit. I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer but there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be to be any reason that this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be built into any controller, commercial or opensource. That way, regardless of vendor, SDN implementation or capabilities everyone can create a SDN path based on the available implementations upstream. Of course, there would need to be a &amp;ldquo;multihop&amp;rdquo; option for those that have to upstream SDN paths. In this case something like a GRE tunnel could be the lowest common denominator. This would have to transcend OpenFlow and be a true &amp;ldquo;SDN&amp;rdquo; at the fundamental level to actually work, but it needs to take into account managing the flow table of networks outside of a given administrative domain. As a starting point, here is the framework I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable transport: TCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication method: MD5 Capabilities exchanged:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of SDN (MPLS, VLAN, DWDM Waves, OpenFlow Version, Flow manipulation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandwidth per circuit (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of circuit or flow (path TTL, permanent?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path validation (to ensure end to end connectivity over negotiated methodology)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking a lot with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkstatic.net/&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; about this.  I know folks are thinking about it.  Bill Owens &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/#comment-47&#34;&gt;had some great comments&lt;/a&gt; to my last post regarding this and I think he&amp;rsquo;s totally spot on.  However, I want to hit 88mph in my Delorean and see the future.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s a ways way off but someone needs to come up with this framework.  SDN is so disjointed that it needs a one ring.  Controlling the forwarding plane of someone else network is scary and needs to have a leash on it.  Building this standard protocol could be it.  Unfortunately, I am no developer but I do know a little bit about running a decent sized network.  There will need to be safeguards, policy and knobs to tweak.  I keep coming back to BGP.  It&amp;rsquo;s not as much of a routing protocol as it is a policy framework disguised as a routing protocol.  There needs to be something similar with SDN. I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue to think through this publicly and I welcome constructive input.     &lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-alto-protocol/&#34;&gt;ALTO&lt;/a&gt; is pretty close.  There has been a lot of work going on but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s all the way to where we need it to be.  Some interesting proof of concept and detail stuff can be read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ewsdn.eu/presentations/ALTOwrtSDN.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://opennetsummit.org/talks/ward-wed.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate feeling about &amp;ldquo;predictions&amp;rdquo; about the upcoming year, especially tech predictions.  I don&amp;rsquo;t like media sensationalism of any kind, and a lot of the tech predctions are just that, sensational, extreme talk to draw in readers or viewers.  I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to go down a more subtle path, these are things I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about lately but will likely forget in the upcoming year, unless they actually happen, in which case I&amp;rsquo;d likely do an &amp;ldquo;ah, I remember thinking that may happen&amp;rdquo; gesture.  Additionally, many of these things are well underway already, but I have a mind like a FIFO pipe, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write them down here to remember to go back and look at them in a few months.  They&amp;rsquo;re sort of a mixed bag of stuff, in no particular order. Lets call these, &amp;ldquo;plausible but not necessarily inevitable; possibly already happening&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/crystal-ball.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/crystal-ball.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;crystal-ball&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 1. Google buys or invests in a mobile carrier.  I was thinking Sprint, but T-Mobile makes more sense because of their GSM network and more global compatibility.  Thins kind of thing has been proposed many times over the last few years and it still makes sense. 2.  Apple buys or invests in Twitter.  This makes a lot of sense to me and would solidify their place in the social networking arena. 3. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aristanetworks.com&#34;&gt;Arista Networks &lt;/a&gt; moves into a larger data center and cloud computing role.  I see big things for this company. they have a very solid pedigree, have an innovative business model and a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; compelling product.   Which leads me to #4. 4. Talks of larger companies (Cisco, Juniper, Dell, Google) purchasing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aristanetworks.com&#34;&gt;Arista Networks&lt;/a&gt;.  This hapens to many of the very innnovative companies.  Remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procket_Networks&#34;&gt;Procket&lt;/a&gt;?  Yeah, most folks don&amp;rsquo;t.  I had the same thoughts about them.  cisco purchased, absorbed and buried them.  I believe their routing pieces were shoved into the nexus. 5.

      <title>Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plexxi.com&#34;&gt;Plexxi&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting product that has recently emerged in the data center space.  While data center, fabric and cloud are all the rage in the buzzword world of data networking, this one caught my attention because it was something unique that I&amp;rsquo;d not seen before.  Their TOR boxes have a few interesting additions to them, the first of which is a WDM port on the back. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not really a stranger to the WDM world.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping maintain a DWDM network in one capacity or another for a little over a decade, but seeing this, by default, in a data center positioned switch?  Now that got my attention. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing&#34;&gt;Wave Division Multiplexing&lt;/a&gt; the ability to slice up light into what telco (and other networking folks) call waves. Each wave is a different &amp;ldquo;color&amp;rdquo; or wavelength.  Plexxi calls their flavor &amp;ldquo;Affinity Networking&amp;rdquo; and it allows for the ability to provision more bandwidth over a single pair of fiber, just like typical WDM. For example, say you have a pair of fiber from one data center to another, either in the same facility or across your city (distances up to 10K now, 70K on the roadmap).  You&amp;rsquo;d normally plug in a 1G or 10G (or 100G if you&amp;rsquo;re really, really well funded) and provision service over that pair of fiber, assuming it is in within distance and optical power spec of the other side.  You&amp;rsquo;re stuck with that interface speed, right?  Wrong. Enter WDM.   On WDM systems you have the ability to provision channels, sometimes in huge amounts, over the same pair.  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen multiple 100G waves, OC192 Waves, a plethora of 10G waves and a few 1G waves all working fine over the same pair of fiber, and where fiber is sparse or prohibitively expensive, this is a big deal. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/prism4c.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/prism4c.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;prism4c&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Plexxi &amp;rdquo;Affinity Networking&amp;rdquo; boasts the ability to do WDM right in the back of their 32 port 10G switches. Very slick.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not all.  Enter part 2.  They also boast software defined (but not OpenFlow) control over the product, enabling dynamic provisioning of  bandwidth, on demand.. They&amp;rsquo;ve purpose built their own proprietary and described as &amp;ldquo;extended&amp;rdquo; version of SDN, geared toward a bigger picture of their network equipment and what it can do.  Their  SDN is called called &amp;ldquo;Plexxi Control&amp;rdquo; and it ties all of their switches together, allowing for a flattening of the network.  I find this approach intriguing, I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the fabric approach to layer 2 a la &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/qfx-series/&#34;&gt;Juniper Qfabric&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/brocade-vdx-first-impressions/&#34;&gt;Brocade VDX&lt;/a&gt;, but the WDM port and the decoupled control together is unique &amp;hellip;.and enthralling. Now, I have not yet had my hands on these boxes, but I think that they will be a piece in what has become a rapidly changing landscape of data centers.  WDM has been around forever in the service provider wide area, but the ability to change bandwidth allocations using WDM on the fly in a commercially supportable commoditized box is game changing.  There have been several research projects in the past that have attempted to do this, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dragon.maxgigapop.net/twiki/bin/view/DRAGON/WebHome&#34;&gt;DRAGON project&lt;/a&gt;, of which one of the sites I helped maintain was a member, attempted to do something like this using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Multi-Protocol_Label_Switching&#34;&gt;GMPLS&lt;/a&gt;  on the WAN gear. Doing it in the data center?  That&amp;rsquo;s new. I look forward to seeing some of these boxes function up close and personal.  I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in the longer distance pieces of these for remote data centers and DR locations.

      <title>SDN across domains in the WAN - a novice look</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 05:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a flurry of discussion on SDN in the WAN lately, specifically, why and how.  Brent Salsbury laid out a few use cases &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/sdn-use-cases-for-service-providers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The why seems pretty straightforward.  I do believe it will happen, however, the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; is the interesting part.  Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m a tad of a greenhorn in the SDN space, I&amp;rsquo;ve made it work in a lab, I participate as much as I can in the working groups and I attempt (poorly) to keep up.   SDN, and likely OpenFlow, is in our roadmap at work.  Doing SDN in the data center is well documented and fairly well tested. Stanford has it all over their campus LAN and Google is pushing it around their walled garden WAN on custom built hardware.  None of this is new.   The interesting bit is &lt;strong&gt;how do you do it across multiple administrative entities&lt;/strong&gt;?  As I said before, I&amp;rsquo;ll never claim to be an SDN expert, so I need to break this down into simple pieces for my limited mind to comprehend.   BGP solved this years and years ago, how is that accomplished?  Can any of these bits be re-used (why re-invent the wheel)? My caveman mind wants to break this down into requirements: This can likely be controlled by access between peers via an access control mechanism of some sort, i.e. place software limits on how much a given peer can provision in your network, which can be broken down into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of circuits (MPLS, VLAN, DWDM Waves, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandwidth per circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of circuit (path TTL, permanent?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of devices involved per circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of SDN (OpenFlow versions, OSCARS, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably more stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be done?  I don&amp;rsquo;t currently know enough to answer that question, but I suspect it may require a little bit of work in adding a peering framework between control planes (SDN controllers) not unlike how BGP works.  To put this in familiar terminology, for example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route maps could be replaced by permissions maps or even an ACL of some sort to establish the abilities of each peer.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peers would need to agree (configuration-wise and politically) on what abilities can be exchanged before peers could operate, programmatically agree on parameters before any changes can be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security parameters would need to be met for the peers to establish to contain the control plane traffic in a safe way, much like an MD5 across a BGP peering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like a tall order, I&amp;rsquo;ll wager you&amp;rsquo;re right and I&amp;rsquo;ll also bet that before it happens we&amp;rsquo;ll have a Blu Ray vs HD-DCD or VHS vs Beta throw down of SDN protocols.   Folks have been trying to do this for years, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dragon.maxgigapop.net/twiki/bin/view/DRAGON/WebHome&#34;&gt;DRAGON project&lt;/a&gt; tried this years ago and did a decent job.  Our Arlington, VA site was one of the original build outs of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://oscars.es.net/OSCARS/docs/&#34;&gt;OSCARS&lt;/a&gt; is doing similar stuff and is actively working across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net/&#34;&gt;ESnet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internet2.edu/ion/&#34;&gt;Internet2 ION&lt;/a&gt; is another attempt. These have all had their effect on the Research and Education networks, but to be adopted acrossm and more importantly between, service provider networks, there needs to be ways to do them elegantly and securely.  There is nothing that a SP hates more than risk, and without these control mechanisms, there is a pretty large amount of risk.  It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to think that this may be there and I&amp;rsquo;m just missing it, since I am admittedly a novice in the SDN world, but if by chance I have not missed it because it&amp;rsquo;s not there, it needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SDN across domains in the WAN - a novice look</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/</link>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a flurry of discussion on SDN in the WAN lately, specifically, why and how.  Brent Salsbury laid out a few use cases &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/sdn-use-cases-for-service-providers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The why seems pretty straightforward.  I do believe it will happen, however, the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; is the interesting part.  Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m a tad of a greenhorn in the SDN space, I&amp;rsquo;ve made it work in a lab, I participate as much as I can in the working groups and I attempt (poorly) to keep up.   SDN, and likely OpenFlow, is in our roadmap at work.  Doing SDN in the data center is well documented and fairly well tested. Stanford has it all over their campus LAN and Google is pushing it around their walled garden WAN on custom built hardware.  None of this is new.   The interesting bit is &lt;strong&gt;how do you do it across multiple administrative entities&lt;/strong&gt;?  As I said before, I&amp;rsquo;ll never claim to be an SDN expert, so I need to break this down into simple pieces for my limited mind to comprehend.   BGP solved this years and years ago, how is that accomplished?  Can any of these bits be re-used (why re-invent the wheel)? My caveman mind wants to break this down into requirements: This can likely be controlled by access between peers via an access control mechanism of some sort, i.e. place software limits on how much a given peer can provision in your network, which can be broken down into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of circuits (MPLS, VLAN, DWDM Waves, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandwidth per circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of circuit (path TTL, permanent?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of devices involved per circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of SDN (OpenFlow versions, OSCARS, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably more stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be done?  I don&amp;rsquo;t currently know enough to answer that question, but I suspect it may require a little bit of work in adding a peering framework between control planes (SDN controllers) not unlike how BGP works.  To put this in familiar terminology, for example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route maps could be replaced by permissions maps or even an ACL of some sort to establish the abilities of each peer.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peers would need to agree (configuration-wise and politically) on what abilities can be exchanged before peers could operate, programmatically agree on parameters before any changes can be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security parameters would need to be met for the peers to establish to contain the control plane traffic in a safe way, much like an MD5 across a BGP peering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like a tall order, I&amp;rsquo;ll wager you&amp;rsquo;re right and I&amp;rsquo;ll also bet that before it happens we&amp;rsquo;ll have a Blu Ray vs HD-DCD or VHS vs Beta throw down of SDN protocols.   Folks have been trying to do this for years, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dragon.maxgigapop.net/twiki/bin/view/DRAGON/WebHome&#34;&gt;DRAGON project&lt;/a&gt; tried this years ago and did a decent job.  Our Arlington, VA site was one of the original build outs of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://oscars.es.net/OSCARS/docs/&#34;&gt;OSCARS&lt;/a&gt; is doing similar stuff and is actively working across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net/&#34;&gt;ESnet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internet2.edu/ion/&#34;&gt;Internet2 ION&lt;/a&gt; is another attempt.

      <title>RYU OpenFlow controller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://osrg.github.com/ryu/index.html&#34;&gt;Ryu&lt;/a&gt;, an openflow controller, was new to me. After doing 5 minutes of reading I knew I needed to get it up in the lab. The thing that caught my eye was that the project page was boasting support for OpenStack. Now, I don;t really have much experience with openstack, but it has a cult like following and it&amp;rsquo;s on my short list of stuff to get involved with. This seemed like a great excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
