<p>
The code name for the switch silicon is <i>GoldenGate</i> built with 32 nm features.
An update <i>GoldenGate2</i> should come out sometime in 2018 and will have about
3X the performance. These switches use PowerPC processors where most of the market
has left them behind and moved on to intel and arm.
<p>
Each of the configurations is available with Centec switch software, netflow agent
software, or tap monitor software. Centec changes the first letter of the model
to indicate the assigned software load: E, V, T.
