This is a switch fabric device that interconnects AS7926 switches to form
very large switch arrays. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010602/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/AS9926-24D.pdf">data sheet</a>
is not a lot of help. For example, the amount of packet memory isn't listed
and that this is a cell-based rather than packet-based fabric is not
data-sheet worthy.

<p>
Arista would put the switches and fabric cards into a chassis where the interconnections
are buried inside the box. Edgecore has used QSFP-DD direct connect cables to assemble
the composite large switch out of individual boxes.
