Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform. Today’s IPv6 Buzz episode explores the benefits of using IPv6 in Kubernetes, and how Kubernetes uses IP addresses in both the control plane and data plane. We also address why the adoption rate is estimated to be so low, from default configurations to issues with non-IPv6-aware applications inside containers. Our guest to help cover this topic is [Wim Henderickx](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wim-henderickx-393b3a/), CTO of the IP Division at Nokia.
