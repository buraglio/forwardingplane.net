Juniper has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/juniper-VoQ.pdf"> good description of a Virtual Output Port</a> 
queued switch. There are also some references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/crossbar.html"> here</a>. Wikipedia
also has an entry for VoQ switching. Output port buffered switches are rare in new 
designs. Cisco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/catalyst6500">Cisco Catalyst 6500</a> and HP 4000Ms have 
substantial output port buffers.
<p>
The main theme for the buffer page is <i>How much buffer is there for a single flow?</i> Packet
buffers for a single <i>queue</i> is essentially the same thing.
This question is easier in a shared memory architecture. In VoQ, we would need to know the switch policies
for dynamic buffer assignment. If the switch has 100 output ports and 8 queues per port, it could be that
buffers are permanently allocated to the 100 x 8 = 800 port-queues. If 12 ports are sharing a single
input ASIC and its 4 GByte packet buffer and
there are 800 port-queues per input port, there is on average about a 0.5 Mbyte per queue.  Pretty whimpy.
<p>

It would be very unlikely that buffer
from one ASIC could be loaned to another ASIC, so sharing on the input side probably can't happen.  On
the other hand, if an output port is oversubscribed by traffic 
coming in from more than one input, VoQ memory on the several
input ports could contribute to virtual output port buffer capacity.
<p>
Whether dynamic or fixed allocations on each input buffer are used will be implementation dependent. Arista
seems to favor dynamic allocation with a cap of 50 mS for any one queue. Whether or not that is exactly
what Arista has done, at least they have <i>said something.</i> Juniper sets the maximum for
the QFX10000 at 100 mS per port. Pretty generous. Sadly, this sort of information rarely populates
data sheets. [added June 2020] The question <i>dynamic vs static</i> is answered for Broadcom in
an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010656/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Arista7800R3SwitchArchitectureWP.pdf">Arista architecture white paper</a>. Buffer
allocation is <b>dynamic</b>. Quoting:
<br>
<blockquote>
. . . the majority of the buffer is allocated in a
dynamic manner wherever it is required across potentially millions of VoQs per system:
<li> ~30% buffer reserved for traffic per Traffic Class per Output Port
<li> ~15% buffer for multi-destination traffic
<li> ~55% available as a dynamic buffer pool
