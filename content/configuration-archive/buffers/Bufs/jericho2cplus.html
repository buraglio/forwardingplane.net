The Linley Group published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/88850-Report1-PUB"> <i>Jericho2c+ Brings 7nm to Routers</i></a> in
their Microprocessor Report. The Linley Group copyrights their reports and sells them for more than $1K each. So rather than making
a copy, I'm linking back to Broadband's page. If, indeed, Broadcom published without permission, this link may get taken down. 
Broadcom has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/88850-PB100.pdf">datasheet.</a>

Linley sees the Jericho2c+ has a peer to the Cisco Q100. The die shrink relative Jericho2 (16 nm) creates a power savings. A
portion of that is used to provide more ports. The rest provides a power reduction from 400W to 350W.

Some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010726/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/dune.html#jericho-family-table"> context</a> that helps place the 2C+ in the jericho family is in
a table. Other varients have also  been announced:
