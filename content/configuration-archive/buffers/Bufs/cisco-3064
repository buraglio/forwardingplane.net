Introduced: March 2011. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/http://www.networkworld.com/article/2201513/servers/cisco-data-center-revamp-cuts-across-switches--servers--storage.html"> Jim Duffy in Network World.</a>
<p>
The Cisco Nexus 3064PQ and 3064X are Trident+ based switches. 
The X replaces the PQ which is no longer for sale.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/command/reference/5_0_3/QOS/3k_cmd_ref_qos.pdf">Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Quality of Service Command Reference</a> allows a deduction that the buffer memory is divided into 46080 208-byte cells which are chained together to make packet buffers.
A white paper titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010736/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/cisco-3064PQ-architecture.pdf">
<i>Cisco Nexus 3064PQ Switch Architecture</i></a> describes buffer allocation in a single sentence:
<p>
<li><b>Shared buffer architecture: The Cisco Nexus 3064PQ has 9 MB of buffer space, including a per-port and dynamically allocated shared buffer.</b>
<p>
Nothing in the documentation explains how the buffer cells are allocated 
to queues. The document that describe this is not public, however Cisco
has given permission to share a picture that is essentially a single
pane from a Powerpoint presentation. It shows the fairness rules
that wrap around dynamic buffer management.

The 3064X has reached end of life. The final product ship date was April 28, 2017.
