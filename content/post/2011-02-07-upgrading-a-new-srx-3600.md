We are putting a few new SRX 3600 clusters into production soon, and we've had them for about 6 months in boxes.  This presented a fairly significant issue, one that I didn't think about until it smacked me in the face. <br />The code on these boxes was old.  Very old.  JunOS 9.2 old. <br />No problem, lets just upgrade them to 10.4R something. <div><b>Wrong</b>.  </div><div><br /></div><div>the code that shipped on these boxes was so old, and we waited so long to upgrade them that I was unable to upgrade them straight to anything modern.  To compound the issue, the upgrade was only able to be performed from certain code level releases as noted <a href="http://forums.juniper.net/t5/SRX-Services-Gateway/SRX-3400-upgrade-failure/m-p/55416">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is a problem.  I logged into the Juniper site to get the appropriate code, low and behold, it's not available.  I had to contact jtac and convince them that the code wasn't there (which was a bit frustrating).  Once they understood the issue (which took a bit longer than I expected; I don't have Agility services on these particular boxes or I would never have had the jtac "issue"), they provided me with a download link for junos-srx3000-9.6R4.4-domestic.  Once I had that code I was able to upgrade to it and then to 10.4.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Not a huge issue, but something that was very annoying to have to jump through since I've never seen this issue upgrading a Juniper device.  </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>[[ This is a content summary only.
