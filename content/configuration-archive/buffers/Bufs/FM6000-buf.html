There may be some uncertainty about how to count switch chip buffer memory. Arista claims 9.5 MB in their datasheet, and clsims
less (8 MB) in a table somewhere else. Falling back to Intel, a full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010614/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/ethernet-switch-fm5000-fm6000-datasheet.pdf">
data sheet</a> is available. 7.5 MBytes in the amount of <b>packet memory</b>. 9.5 Mbytes is the total on-chip RAM that
includes memory for pointers and other non-data things. Thanks to Olivier Montanuy for pointing out this discrepancy.
