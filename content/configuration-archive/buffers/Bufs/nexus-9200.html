Cisco did a raft of announcements that included 9200s. Previous version
used a trident-2 along with Cisco custom ALE-2 ASIC that fixed warts
in the trident-2. The new 92xx switches are full custom: ASE-2 and ASE-3. 
Date of first publication of the hardware installation guide is 
Feb 8, 2016. Since
this web page is primarily about buffering:

This was copied out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010556/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/nexus-9200-arch.pdf">
architecture paper</a>. The <i>newer</i> 9200 claims to have less
memory than the <i>older</i> 9300. That is because the 9300 was a
warts-on-a-pig product.
<p>
Note that the ASICs are built in <i>slices</i> with memory belonging
to each slice.  This is perhaps the first silicon designed to address
Elephant versus Mice flows. The ASE claims to find the elephants 
on the fly and decrease their priority to keep the world safe for 
mice. Sadly, the architecture paper does not disclose the number
of elephants and mice that can be active in the ASE ASIC at one time.
<p>
This is good for the data center, and probably not good for big
science in the wide area. In a world of 100 uS RTT, elephants 
can rapidly climb to fill all buffers. This starves the mice. But
it is not clear this happens in WAN networking.
<p>
The Nexus 9200 shares the same bug as the first generation of
Broadcom Tomahawk ASICs. In both cases, the ASIC design was committed
before the 25 Gb/s specification was written. In both cases, this
means that while 25 Gb/s ports can be used for direct attach copper
cables, they cannot be used with optic modules. Neither Cisco
nor Broadcom explain this, but the difference between the Nexus 9300
which does not have the problem and the 9200 is clear from the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010556/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Cisco&#32;25-G-compatibility.pdf">25 Gb/s compatibility matrix</a>.
