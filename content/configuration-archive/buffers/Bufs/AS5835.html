<b>Introduced June 2020</b>
<p>
These switches both have BCM56771 ASICs. At the introduction of the Trident3
Broadcom made it clear that the big bear in the family -- BCM56870 6.4 Tbps full duplex -- would be introduced first
and intermediate power ASICs would follow. These switches are distinguished from
the AS7326-54X with fewer uplink ports (6 instead of 8) and lower speed on the
downlink ports (10G instead of 25G).
