<p>
These switches have 24 and 48 10 Gb/s SFP+ ports and QSFP uplinks that
match the speeds and feeds of Broadcom's Trident2. The pictures certainly
suggest that these are similar to Trident2 products. A careful reading
of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010548/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/6720-specifications.pdf">specifications</a>
suggests that these switches were probably inspired
by the Broadcom competitors, but contain Huawei silicon. The data sheets
and docs make no mention of either cut-thru switching or VxLAN. And
the introduction date measured by the first version date in the documentation
is July 2015 which lags behind other Trident2 implementations.
<p>
This is Huawei's second 10 Gb/s switch. Their first issue was/is the
6700 family. It was introduced in October 2014. These switches do not
have the uplink slot on the back and that cuts the max PPS forwarding
rate relative to 6720.
<p>
Huawei's specifications are <i>frustrating</i>. There are no references
to RFCs. And specifications for system packet buffers are nowhere to be
found. Well, almost nowhere. Huawei commissioned a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010548/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Tolly215159HuaweiS6720EISwitchFeatures.pdf">Tolly review</a> of
the product. Curiously, Tolly reports an entirely respectible 8 Mbyte
buffer for a single port. Tolly says nothing about how he got the number.
And it isn't in Huawei's information. 
<p>
Reviewing Huawei documentation is certainly a special experience. The
sum of the contents of of the books that make up the manual set are
over 180 Megabytes of PDFs. The <i>Command reference</i> by itself is 33 MB and over
8,800 pages long. Information on buffers in switches from other manufacturers
is usually
contained in the QoS chapter, or failing that -- in the command reference.
Huawei seems to have gone to special pains to describe buffer management
<i>without</i> disclosing what is in the box. I lifted the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010548/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/6720-buffer.pdf">most relevant page</a> from the Command Reference. 
I suspect that
the chip has 12 MB of packet memory and 8 MB is the port limit when the
switch operates in <i>extreme</i> mode.
<p>
Without any information, I suspect that these Huawei switches may well be a price
leader among switches in their class.
