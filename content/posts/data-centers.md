Data centers are one of the hot things in networking tech right now.  Combine SDN, cloud, buzzword of the day, mix with data center and serve over ice.  
I end up doing a lot with data centers for whatever reason.  [This](http://www.stanford.edu/~alizade/Site/DCTCP.html), however, is something I found interesting.  
_"DCTCP is an enhancement to the TCP congestion control algorithm for data center networks. It leverages Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), a feature which is increasingly becoming available in modern data center switches. DCTCP sources extract multi-bit feedback on congestion from the single-bit stream of ECN marks by estimating the fraction of marked packets. In doing so, DCTCP sources react to the extent of congestion, not just the presence of congestion as in TCP.  This finer level of control allows DCTCP to operate with very low buffer occupancies while simultaneously achieving high throughput.
