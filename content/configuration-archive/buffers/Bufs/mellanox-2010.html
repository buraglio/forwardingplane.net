Mellanox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010702/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/spectrum.pdf">announced their 100 Gb/s switch chip</a> on June 18, 2015. In common with
Broadcom's Tomahawk ASIC, it has 128 ser-des. <i>Ser-des</i> is the <i>serializer-deserializer</i>
that converts words in the switch to and from a serial bit stream.  Ser-des can be combined in groups
of four to make QSFP 4-lane ports that can run at 100 Gb/s or 40 Gb/s. Or they
can be used individually to create 25 Gb/s or 10 Gb/s ports.  Both Tomahawk
and Spectrum have 16 MBytes of packet memory.
<p>
Tomahawk has four switch cores while Spectrum has one. Each core manages its
own packet buffer pool, so Broadcom can marshal at most 4 MBytes toward
a big flow.
Spectrum can dedicate the entire dynamic buffer pool to a single hot flow.
Tomahawk presumably uses a 4-core design to improve lookups per second in
quest of non-blocking performance. Mellanox claims non-blocking performance
without a multi-core design. Mellanox is driving home the
4-core vs single core difference with
