Having worked on both and done POC for 5800 and Supermassive, if you enable any DPI function or SSL offload, the SRX chokes while the Supermassive hums along. There are only a couple configurations where the SRX has the SonicWALL beat. Check out Network testing and NSS labs results for independent testing. I can send them to you if you wish. /p Nick Buraglio - Dec 1, 2012</description>

      <description>~12 years ago I had a drinking buddy that worked with me at the regional ISP. We had a lot in common, he had been an icon back in the didjits era of punk rock in Champaign Urbana and we had briefly been in a terrible band together. He introduced me to a dude that to this day I just knew as &amp;ldquo;Ravi Sonicwall&amp;rdquo;. He had apparently been recruited from the U of I, written a lot of the low level pieces of the original sonicwall and retired to enjoy life and buy beers (he actually scolded me at a bar for buying him a beer saying &amp;ldquo;when I&amp;rsquo;m in town, I buy the beers&amp;rdquo;).</description>
