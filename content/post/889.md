I recently had a conversation with Brent Salisbury that re-introduced a bit of a hot button with me.  The term "next-generation" is over used and at this point arguably meaningless.  So many things are labeled "next-generation" that, while technically true, they may be the next in a line of product, the term has entered marketing typecast.
