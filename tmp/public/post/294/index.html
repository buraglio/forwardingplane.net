    <div class="content"> <p>I am very happy and flattered that this site actually proves to be useful to folks. It was always my intention to use this as a platform to try to give back a bit, to help with any data I may have run across that was interesting, useful, or obscure.  I utilize sites like <a href="http://www.etherialmind.com">etherialmind.com</a>, <a href="http://www.packetpushers.net">packetpushers.net</a>, <a href="http://www.evilrouters.net">evilrouters.net</a>, <a href="http://wwwmetworkstatic.net">networkstatic.net</a> and <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info">ioshints</a> more than I can even measure.  I wanted to try to contribute as much as I could to pay it back.  So, seeing at it&rsquo;s a new year and all, I couldn&rsquo;t resist doing some data mining on the analytics of this site over the course of the last 12 months. I was once again surprised to see that a firewall post was clearly the most popular.  The <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/sonicwall-old-dog-learns-some-new-tricks/" title="Sonicwall – Old dog learns [some] new tricks">recent post on the Sonicwall</a> was the clear, overwhelming winner having more than twice the views as it&rsquo;s closest rival. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg" alt="" title="rear_view_mirror" /></a> It&rsquo;s interesting to see that, especially since most of what I do every day is routing and switching.  However, when this site was originally brought online back in 2008 (as tech.buraglio.com) to house my <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/updating-srx-idp-signatures/" title="Updating SRX IDP signatures">very</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/08/juniper-srx-cluster/" title="Juniper SRX Cluster">rough</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/srx-ipv6-flow-based-processing/" title="SRX IPv6 flow based processing">notes</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/multicast-through-juniper-srx-5800/" title="Multicast through Juniper SRX 5800">on</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/enabling-ipv6-on-juniper-srx-5800-cluster/" title="Enabling IPv6 on Juniper SRX 5800 cluster">the</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/01/moving-junos-code-between-srx-cluster-nodes/" title="Moving JunOS code between SRX cluster nodes">Juniper</a> <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/02/upgrading-a-new-srx-3600/" title="Upgrading a new SRX 3600">SRX</a> platform that I had the pleasure of being a very early adopter of, it was really obvious that folks wanted to see that data.  Those posts, although somewhat old, continue to be pretty popular. The <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/plexxi-could-be-wdm-for-the-rest-of-us/" title="Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us.">post on Plexxi</a> and the <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/" title="SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look">post on SDN across the WAN</a> are also pretty popular and both are subjects I will likely revisit as time permits. I&rsquo;m working on many, many cool projects this year and I plan to write notes on every one of them.  Hopefully they&rsquo;ll be useful to someone.   Welcome to 2013.  Let&rsquo;s blow some minds, melt some faces and push some envelopes.</p>
