The Altoline <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010754/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/hp5712.pdf">5712</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010754/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/hp6712.pdf"> 6712</a> were introduced August 24, 2015. 
The switches are specifically for the ONIE market. In addition to Trident2 Broadcom BCM56854 switch ASICs, these switches have
Intel Atom processors.  In February HP announced its plan to offer two switches
from Accton Technology for the <i>open</i> market. These are based on Accton's  AS5712-54X which they also
sell direct under the Edge-corE brand.
