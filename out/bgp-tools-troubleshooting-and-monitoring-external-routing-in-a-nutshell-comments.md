Another great site that should probably be on the "notable mentions" is the CIDR report. CIDR report provides a nice, easy to read and up to date breakdown of the global routing table for both IPv4 and IPv6. Great to utilize for trending and planning if you're not monitoring your own tables (which you should be) and as an impartial data source for the global table. http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/

That is unfortunate you started in 1999. Because the O'Reilly book by Iljitsch van Beijnum is a lot easier to read. Not as dry and not as thick. :-) He gives courses too. You can also make deals with a community to get information out of their networks like NLNOG RING or RIPE Atlas Probe. And RIPE RIS and RIPE Atlas are very useful tools. This scares me: "arguably the most important device on the network"

I'm a huge fan of the NLNOG Ring nodes. I've implemented them in more than one network. I've only got 3 RIPE probes so far but I'm going to install at least 2 more soon. Fantastic tool.
