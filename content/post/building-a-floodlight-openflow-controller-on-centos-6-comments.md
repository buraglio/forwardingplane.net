Tks - nice short article that just got me going. Two thinks I found; 1) When you "git" floodlight is now builds a directory called floodlight that you have to drop down into to run ant. 2) The current version of floodlight needs 64 bit Java to run. Not sure if you can hack it to run with 32 bit, I just reloaded a 64 bit version. Comments only meant to be helpful, Tks again. Regards IAN

You will find some intriguing points in time in this article but I don't know if I see all of them center to heart. There is certainly some validity but I will take hold opinion until I look into it further. Excellent write-up , thanks and we want more!
