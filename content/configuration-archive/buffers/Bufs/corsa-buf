Corsa switches are built on FPGAs. This makes them cousins to the 
Brocade MLXe. Buffer allocation profiles cover cases like
<i>dedicated per-port</i> and <i>shared buffer pool</i>. 
It seems like you select a buffer profile and (re)boot the 
switch and it initializes to those parameters. Or something
like that. As such, buffering is outside the scope of control
of SDN.
