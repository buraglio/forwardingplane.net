<p>
No mention of the manufactuer on the slide. The ODM is likely Edge-core,
based on the first two letters in the model number. 
This slide was lifted from the Nephos
booth at the OpenCompute summit in March 2018. No mention of this
product on the net.

<b>Update</b>
<p>
Even though it is clear that this is an Edge-core part number,
it does not appear to have a data sheet. Perhaps Edge-core dipped
a toe in the nephos waters and then backed out.
