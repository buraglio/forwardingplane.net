<h2>HP2824 and HP4100gl</h2>
<p>
The HP 2824 was announced in October 2003. End of life was announced on August 1, 2009.
HP's free lifetime warranty stopped with the<i> end of service life</i> in 2014.
<p>
 HP's Procurve division followed a procedure of developing switch technology which was then
packaged as a single rack unit switch and as a configurable chassis switch. The 2824 and 4100gl are such a pair. The 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010710/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/switch_4100gl_series.pdf">4104</a> lists
512 KB as buffer memory in its data sheet while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010710/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/2824-datasheet.pdf"> 2824 data sheet</a> is silent. We'll take
the number from 4104 and apply it to the 2824.
<p>
HP noticed customer interest in packet buffer memory about ten years ago. Before then, QoS features that classified packets
were well described in the manuals but HP didn't have a lot to say about queue sizes. HP's interest in queue size is
covered in the write-up of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010710/http://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/HP2920">HP 2920</a>. The 2800 series switches divide 
packet memory into four seperate queues. These queues are silos, protected from each other with no <i>borrowing</i> permitted.
 This is good for QoS but not for line rate switch performance. HP provided a
switch configuration called <i>Pass-Through Mode</i> that addresses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010710/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/HP-passthru-mode.pdf"> line rate performance.</a>
