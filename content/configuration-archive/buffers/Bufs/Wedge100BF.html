<p>
This switch is a <i>me too</i> implimentation of the Wedge100C
changing out the Cavium ASIC for a Tofino. It is available
as either 32 or 65 100G ports. It was introduced to the
OpenCompute Project in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010706/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/barefoot-preso.pdf"> short
slide show.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010706/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Barefoot&#32;Wedge&#32;100B&#32;OCP&#32;Spec-prt.pdf">
more formal presentation spec</a> is in the OCP project files.

<td>Taking photos while crusing the OCP show floor is an 
imperfect process. If you don't know what you're looking for, you
can easily miss something. This sign was within the camera view
of a picture of a different switch. Presumably if I had looked,
I would have seen it. Perhaps more valuable than yet another switch
<i>beauty shot</i> is  the indication
of software that supports the Tofino. This picture was taking
on March 21, 2018.</td>

While it would be most comforting if Edgecore had a data sheet
for the switch, it is of some consolation that both the 32
and 65 port versions are listed as <i>for sale</i> on the 
KernelSoftware web site. But just because you can order it doesn't
mean you can get it.

The Wedge100BF-32X has a more traditional Edgecore P/N AS7616-32X.

The Wedge100BF-65X has a more traditional Edgecore P/N AS7616-65X.
