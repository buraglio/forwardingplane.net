Announced in 2013 along with Trident 2 switches from other vendors. There are
actually three members to the family. The fixed configuration 32-port all QSFP 
varient is not shown here. Picture of the fixed config is in the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/hp5930-datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a>. The all-QSFP version was the first to
be introduced and the modular configurations came later. The 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010711/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/HP-5930.pdf">original datasheet</a> showed only the QSFP model.
<p>
Each module has twenty-four 10 Gb/s ports and two QSFP ports. The 10 Gb/s ports
can be either 10GbaseT or SFP+. And you can have that with or without MACSEC.
And there is also a module with eight QSFP ports, shown in the top picture,
