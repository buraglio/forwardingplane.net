Cisco does not make fixed configuration switches with Jericho2 ASICs; they use the ASICs 
in high-end line cards for chassis solutions. Arista makes chassis cards too, but not reviewed here.
Arista makes switches with QSFP-DD and OSFP optics plugins. Jericho2 switches can contain
external TCAM, or not. External TCAM is indicated by a <b>K</b> in the model number.
Overall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010742/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7280R3-Data-Sheet.pdf"> there are ten models.</a>
<p>
<b>OSFP</b> means <b>Octal</b>SFP, so 8 lanes, 50 Gb/s PAM4 yields 400 Gb/s.
<p>
<b>QSFP-DD</b> means 2X quad, so 8 lanes, 50 Gb/s PAM4. Yields 400 Gb/s. QSFP-DD has its
plug connector on the back end arranged so that a QSFP module can slide into the slot and
be recognized as a single density QSFP. This provides backward compatibilty and what they
call <i>investment protection</i>.
<p>
<b>OSFP</b> modules are larger which lets them disipate more heat and thus do stuff
beyond the thermal limits of QSFP-DD. An example announced on March 9, 2020 is the
coherant 400G-ZR transceiver paired with an EDFA optical amplifier.

This transceiver and amplifier pair are expected to start shipping in the second half of 2020.

<h2>Packet Buffers</h2>
Each Jericho2 ASIC is co-packaged with an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010742/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/hbm-explanation.html">8 GB hbm</a> memory.
This memory is used to store packets when the on-chip 16 MB memory starts to fill.
The question <i>dynamic vs static</i> buffers is answered for Broadcom in
an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010742/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Arista7800R3SwitchArchitectureWP.pdf">Arista architecture white paper</a>. Buffer
allocation is <b>dynamic</b>. Quoting:
<br>
<blockquote>
. . . the majority of the buffer is allocated in a
dynamic manner wherever it is required across potentially millions of VoQs per system:
<li> ~30% buffer reserved for traffic per Traffic Class per Output Port
<li> ~15% buffer for multi-destination traffic
<li> ~55% available as a dynamic buffer pool
