      <title>NAT IPv4 and Public IPv6</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently taken to thinking a lot more about IPv6. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an HE tunnel for as long as I can remember at home. This poses an interesting question about addressing. Since I have not had a public address block at home for almost 7 years, I have been using NAT for IPv4. However, my IPv6 netblocks are a /64 and a /48, which are both far more address space than I could ever possibly use.</description>

      <title>Setting IPv6 precedence under FreeBSD</title>

      <description>I had been discussing IPv6 address precedence recently and realized that I&amp;rsquo;d never really messed with it. I have a FreeBSD host that has multiple IPv6 addresses, an EUI-64 address as well as a statically assigned address. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what IPv6 or EUI-64 is, I suggest you brush up because IPv6 is coming and it&amp;rsquo;s coming sooner than you thing.
Using the ip6addrctl command I can manipulate which address is preferred for outbound connections.</description>
