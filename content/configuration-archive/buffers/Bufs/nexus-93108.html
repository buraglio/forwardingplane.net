Cisco custom ASIC code name <b>Sugarbowl</b> and now refered to as <b>LSE</b> (Leaf
and spine engine). 
Claims to be the first 16 nM network ASIC.
On-chip buffer memory is 40 MBytes. This switch is the logical successor to the Nexus 9372
that was introduced in September 2014. The same ASIC is used in linecards for the modular
Nexus 9500 chassis: N9K-X9732C-EX, N9K-X97160YC-EX.

Cisco produced an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010546/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/nexus-9300-whitepaper.pdf"> 
architecture paper</a>. The LSE (Leaf Spine Engine) is partitioned 
into two cores, each of which gets half the 40 MB of memory.

<p>
Buffer is composed of <i>particles</i> [cells] that are used in 
sufficient number to hold each frame. The maximum wasted packet 
memory per frame is thus 207 bytes when the last cell holds a single byte.
