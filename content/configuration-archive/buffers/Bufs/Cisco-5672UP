Cisco announced the 5672UP in January, 2014. 
It uses the same port ASIC as the Nexus 6001 introduced a year earlier. 
The port ASIC can support 3 x 40 Gb/s or 12 x 10 Gb/s ports.
<i>UP</i> in the model name indicates that sixteen of the ports are <i>Unified</i>.
This means they can run Ethernet, Fiber Channel, or Fiber Channel over Ethernet.
<p>
Nexus 5xxx switches are configured with an array of port ASICs connected
by a cross-bar fabric. A major difference between the 55xx and 56xx is
that in the former, buffer is dedicated per-port. The later has more buffer
and it forms a shared pool for all the ports on the ASIC. A key point is
in this slide:

In <i>big data</i> wide area networking, burst absorption is more important than
predictable performance. And the 5672 has an array of cool ways to find out when
and where you are dropping frames and to see how full buffers are running. In
common with many other Cisco data sheets, information about buffers is hard to
find. It is exposed in deep dive sessions at Cisco-live, which is where I
stole the slide. Note that buffer allocation is <i>flexible</i>. That means 
some configuration will be required to get it to do the right thing for
SciDMZ applications. This is hardly unique.
<p>
Some of the input buffer packet memory is dedicated to each port. This is 
necssary to avoid head-of-line blocking. A small amount is used to hold 
packets sent to span ports. 14 MB is therefore the size of the shared pool.
There is also 9 MB of output packet buffers.  
3 MB of this is used for unicast packets.
Under the most optimistic situation where only a single flow is claiming
buffer space, 17 MB is available for burst absorption.
<p>
Both the Nexus 6001 and 5672UP have fine grained buffer monitoring built
into their switch ASICs. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010553/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/nexus-buffer-mon.pdf">read
