      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t endorse or condemn products for free or for money [and if I did I would disclose it in bold lettering for the world to see]. I will strive to provide a fact based description, experience or assessment of any given technology or product based on my particular experience.  I may provide opinions as to what I believe is the right or wrong $item, $idea, $process, or $procedure on any given subject again based on my personal experiences. My employer is in no way represented by anything I may say or do, nor is my family, group of friends, neighbors or random stranger that may perform the same job function as myself. Take everything I say, type or do with a grain of salt.  I do.&lt;/p&gt;
