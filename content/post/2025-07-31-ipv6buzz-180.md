There are many, many reasons, methods, and orders of operation when starting out in IPv6. In this episode of IPv6 Buzz, Tom and I continue our IPv6 Basics series discussing deployment.  We’ll help you sort out why you should deploy IPv6, things to consider before starting a deployment, and what approach you should take such as “inside out” vs. “outside in” and when you should deploy IPv6. Lastly we explain why you should seek out some training for deploying IPv6.
