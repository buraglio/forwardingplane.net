Well! New year, new podcast. I've been fortunate enough to move from "most frequent guest" to full-on co-host of [IPv6Buzz](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/ipv6-buzz), and I am pretty freakin' stoked if I am being completely honest!

We're out of the gate with a bang, too. This first podcast of 2025 (and first with me as a co-host) is diving right in with some bold predictions:

`IPv6 adoption should cross 50% in 2025.`

We discuss the implications and significance of IPv6 adoption reaching this milestone. While this transition might not be visible to average users, it does impact IT professionals. We explore varying adoption rates across industries, and talk about compliance requirements will soon necessitate IPv6. We also dig into the psychological and operational aspects of this shift, and how thoughtful planning for IPv6 adoption and fluency in both IPv4 and IPv6 can help.
