                <p>Anyone that looks at this site with any regularity may have noticed that I have been pretty remiss in adding posts - for that I apologize, things have been busy. However, I have not been absent in the tech world&hellip;quite the opposite, in fact. I&rsquo;ve been spending more and more time on podcasts and other forms of tech media which I have not provided links for here. So, to help expose that, here are a few of the other media resources I&rsquo;ve been popping up in. Professionally I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of my time testing things like <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/srr1/">segment routing</a>, software routing stacks for <a href="https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/2_White_The_State_Of_Open_Source_Routers.pdf">disaggregated routing</a>, DDoS detection and DDoS mitigation. In the free time I would typically spend in my home lab, I&rsquo;ve become enamored with Wireless ISPs and how they work. I&rsquo;d done some WISP work off and on over the years but it was primarily focused on L3 - I&rsquo;ve gone deeper and started learning about more RF strategy and detail as well as delved pretty deeply into a fair amount of the gear details. There is some <em>crazy</em> good, innovative stuff going on in this space and it happily hums along well outside of the hype engines that are the juggernauts of hyperscale data center and enterprise networking. I find it a refreshing change from the marketing machine of the mainstream networking industry, representing more of what the real world of being a smaller service provider is like (which is where I got started, so there is an amount of nostalgic comfort there), and there are folks out there are serious use cases for things like SR and <a href="https://rule11.tech/?s=disaggregated">disaggregated routing</a> just waiting to be tested. <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_3777.jpg"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_3777.jpg" alt="" /></a> In addition, I&rsquo;ve been involved in a few projects regarding security and DDoS detection and mitigation (CoreFlow) that have been pretty interesting, one of which which <a href="https://tnc17.geant.org/core/presentation/30">I recently presented on at TNC 17 in Linz, Austria</a>. Slides can be found <a href="https://tnc17.geant.org/getfile/3728">here</a>. More information can be found on the project CoreFlow in the published paper <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=fr&amp;user=alONArcAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=alONArcAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll probably talk more about this project focused on ISP DDoS detection and mitigation as the code matures, but feel free to contact me with questions/comments. <a href="http://blog.ipspace.net/2017/06/packet-fabric-on-software-gone-wild.html">Packet Fabric Podcast on IPSpace.net</a> Also see Ivan&rsquo;s page for <a href="http://www.ipspace.net/Podcast/Software_Gone_Wild">Software Gone wild</a> for more podcasts (both that I have been involved in and other good content) Brothers WISP Video on the basics of DNS (see also <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2016/02/nix4neteng-6-dns-ad-blocking-and-quality-of-experience/">NIX for NetEng DNS</a>, or <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/06/nix4neteng-2-ipv46-address-investigation-tools-whois-dig/">NIX for NetEng address tools</a>)</p>
