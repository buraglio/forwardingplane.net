<h2>Arista 7060CX-32 and 7260CX-64</h2>
<p>
<table width="800">
<tr><td>
Introduced Sept 14 2015
<p>
Arista becomes third to announce products based on Broadcom's Tomahawk switch chip. The 7060 and 7260 
Tomahawk products have 25 Gb/s SERDES that can run at 25 or 10 Gb/s and therefore supporting port speeds
of 10, 25, 40, 50 and 100 Gb/s. Not sure what the <b>QX</b> is. The 7260 appears to be made from four Tomahawks
with half the ports used to support chip-to-chip interconnect. Note that 1 Gb/s is not a legal speed for
the SFP+ ports. There are two SFP+ ports that can run downspeed.

As noted elsewhere, Tomahawk has four switch cores, each with a lookup engine and each with its own 4 MByte memory buffer pool.
Dynamic buffering happens within the domain of a single core. Buffers cannot be loaned to other cores. So for bursty best effort
traffic, the most buffer that can be claimed by a single core is 3 MByte -- 
depending on how much is reserved for dedicated port buffers.
<p>
Arista has published a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010607/https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/7060X_7260X_QA.pdf"> QandA doc</a> for the new switches. Since we are particularly interested in buffers:
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>What are the advantages of buffer allocation on the 7060X series?</b>
<p>
The 7060X/7260X series provides a best of both worlds approach to buffering. Combining a shared/dynamic
buffer architecture with a small segment size, which together are designed to ensure maximum efficiency by
minimizing ‘unusable’ buffer space. In addition the 7060CX and 7260CX switches have 133% of total buffer
compared with the 7050X platforms.
</blockquote>
It is not clear that <i>best of both worlds</i> is anything new. 
Arista's Martin Hull described a similar system in a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010607/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Arista_7050X_Switch_Architecture.pdf">2013 paper</a>
that accompanied introduction of Trident II products.
What Tomahawk 
promises to bring is <i>more buffer</i> and, for highly bursty data
transfers, the allocation of this memory to cores puts Arista's claims
in the <i>disingenuous</i> category.  Note that depending on the location
of the input and output ports, a packet might touch a single switch core
or it might touch two cores. It is possible that it might <i>taste</i> of
two memory pools. If the internal connections between the cores are 
flow-controlled, perhaps the effective buffer size might be 4+4 = 8 MByte.
No one has said this yet, and we'll be watching. In any case, this is
still less buffer than the single core trident+ and trident2.
