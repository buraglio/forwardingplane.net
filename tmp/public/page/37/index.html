    I am a network engineer by profession, but with the proliferation of SDN and OpenFlow, I have had to spend a lot of time re-learning a lot of system admin skills that I&#8217;d shelved years ago. Now, I&#8217;ve been a virtualization user forever. From VMware (Fusion, ESX), VirtualBox, to Parallels, I&#8217;ve used them at least in testing if not in production environments. I&#8217;d not really spent any mentionable amount of time with XEN, qEMU or KVM, but some projects I was working on suggested it for the virtualization mechanism, so I figured I&#8217;d try to pick it up.

    I&#8217;ve recently run into a situation where there was no longer enough space in the FIB to handle both the full IPv4 global table and the full IPv6 global table. We prefer to run a default-free network within this particular SP network, but in this case, until a hardware refresh can happen, we&#8217;ll need to adjust that. Given what we knew about the size of both tables, it made more sense to take a default IPv6 route from one transit provider and filter the rest.

    Last year, Networking Field Day was something that I&#8217;d heard of but wasn&#8217;t really aware of what is really was. I occasionally looked at Twitter and saw the hash tags but did not know much about how it was set up or what it was about. In fact, I actually thought it was supposed to be like the HAM radio field day stuff where you go out and build out an emergency network on the fly.

    I started working on Juniper equipment around 2002. At my employer, we had an M40 with the serial number 256. We did Layer3 only. I had no idea if the Juniper even did layer2. It certainly wasn&#8217;t a layer3 switch like a 6500 like I was used to. It was like a deliciously robust version of any Layer 3 router I&#8217;d worked on previously. Over the years Juniper has added a switching line utilizing their FreeBSD based OS, JunOS.

    OK, maybe they&#8217;re not totally dead, but they&#8217;re being demoted. To the mail room.
During the course of my career I&#8217;ve always had at least some responsibility for firewall and security devices. In those ~15 years, how these boxes are built and function has shifted. From the perspective of my career, there were IOS ACLs (yes, I know, not a firewall), there was the IOS firewall versions and there were software packages such as gauntlet, checkpoint.

    This week there was a lot of buzz about SDN (as usual). There was alightreading thread that I commented on and a fantastic read by Brent Salisbury about being the steamroller and not the road that got me thinking about OpenFlow and SDN in a way I had not before.


All that is old is new again. I remember when internal networks were small and routing protocols were taboo in many internal environments.

    Lately I&#8217;ve been lamenting the fact that there seems to be a lack of options in a very specific product level. Lets say you have a network that looks like this:
&nbsp;
Right Away you&#8217;re limited since you need MPLS and more than 2 10G interfaces. Even more so if you require full support for IPv6 and ISIS.
If budget is of any concern, you&#8217;re in real trouble.
For many, Cisco pricing and smartnet is potentially going to exclude anything reasonable from them.

    The SDN world is abuzz with the announcement that the OpenDaylight controller came from stealth mode today. Why is this important? Well, SDN and OpenFlow are fractured. It is Mac vs. PC, Beta vs VHS, Coke vs. Pepsi all over again&#8230;&#8230;multiplied by 100x and with a handful of players.

Vendor zealots and brand loyalists will nearly always side with their camp. Heck, even I have some biases of personal preference.

    OpenFlow is, of course, a hot buzzword. It&#8217;s the newest, and in my opinion, the most innovative thing to hit data networking since dynamic routing. The ability to programmatically, systematically and potentially dynamically control traffic at the flow level through a network is innovative, exciting and terrifying [to many network engineers and architects] at the same time. Allowing applications to touch the network change behavior is something that many engineers are not terribly comfortable with.

    I had been working, off and on, on a how-to for building the daylight openflow controller under CentOS. Most openflow docs and dev are done under ubuntu or debian, and while those are both fantastic alternatives, there are a huge number of folks that will want or need to use RHEL or CentOS. So, seeing as that is the case, having someone be mindful of that is important. When I saw the write up by Jon Langemak, I scrapped my attempt at a how-to since his was so much better.
