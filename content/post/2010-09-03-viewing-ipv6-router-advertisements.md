I knew a tool like this had to exist, but I had never needed to look in the past.  While debugging a RA problem, I come upon the need to view IPv6 router advertisements.  How can one do this?  tcpdump?  Yeah, I guess that could work.  It's almost like using a bulldozer when a wheelbarrow is all you need, though.  I could use [ndpmon](http://ndpmon.sourceforge.net/), I suppose, but that, too seems like overkill. 
So, the search began. After about 10 seconds of google searching..... Success!  A tool, does in fact exist for viewing exactly that type of packet. 
Enter [radvdump](http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/linuxcommand.org/man_pages/radvdump8.html).  It is part of the marvelous [rtadvd](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rtadvd&sektion=8) project.  It also exists in [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/). 

Sweet, now I can see my IPv6 router advertisements in a very simple manner.  The syntax is very straightforward, the command sudo /opt/local/sbin/radvdump will yield you pretty much everything you need to know about what is in your router advertisement:


#
# radvd configuration generated by radvdump 1.6
# based on Router Advertisement from fe80::20d:b9ff:fe18:8ca1
# received by interface en0
#

interface en0
{
 AdvSendAdvert on;
 # Note: {Min,Max}RtrAdvInterval cannot be obtained with radvdump
 AdvManagedFlag off;
 AdvOtherConfigFlag off;
 AdvReachableTime 0;
 AdvRetransTimer 0;
 AdvCurHopLimit 64;
 AdvDefaultLifetime 1800;
 AdvHomeAgentFlag off;
 AdvDefaultPreference medium;
 AdvSourceLLAddress on;


 prefix 2001:470:xxxx:xxx::/64
 {
 AdvValidLifetime 2592000;
 AdvPreferredLifetime 604800;
 AdvOnLink on;
 AdvAutonomous on;
 AdvRouterAddr off;
 }; # End of prefix definition


 <s
pan style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">prefix 2001:470:xxxx:xxx::/64
 {
 AdvValidLifetime 2592000;

 AdvOnLink on;
 AdvAutonomous on;
 AdvRouterAddr off;
 }; # End of prefix definition


}; # End of interface definition


Once you have all of that working, head over to see the [dancing kame](http://www.kame.net/) (if you're old school) of just head to [my main domain](http://www.buraglio.com/) and it'll show you your ipv4 or ipv6 address at the top. Alternatively, you can use [google over ipv6](http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/) in a number of [ways](http://ipv6.google.com/).
