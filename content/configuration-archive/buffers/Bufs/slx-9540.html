Confirmed by Brocade as a Qumran Broadcom switch with off-switch buffer memory. 
Brocade characterizes this as a deep buffer switch -- and that seems fair.
There is a <a herf="./brocade-slx-9540-switch-ds.pdf">data sheet</a> that
claims switch fabric capacity of 1.08 Tb/s which exceeds the 800 Mb/s that
Broadcom thinks the switch can handle. Brocade's number is simply the 
sum of the port bandwidths of the 48 + 6 ports. That is probably an
overly simplistic way to characterize the switch.
