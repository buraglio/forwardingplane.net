      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.packetpushers.net&#34;&gt;Packet Pushers&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting in on the inagural &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQ9ppGwrEo&amp;amp;t=1668s&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Packet Pushers Weekend Edition&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - an informal, video round table where we discuss fun and relevant topics in the space of networking and other related IT topics. Much discussion was had on SR-MPLS, Service providers, SD-WAN, and Cloud. I hope to participate again, as I found the experience both entertaining and informative, I hope you will too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tune in here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ElastiFlow Template VM</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/elastiflow-template-vm/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2019 18:11:58 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/elastiflow-template-vm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flow data is a critical piece of understanding how your network works what what it is actively doing. It also provides a great baseline and capacity planning tool. However, some of the more feature rich NetFlow and/or sFlow collectors can be quite daunting in their cost and/or complexity to install. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow&#34;&gt;ElastiFlow&lt;/a&gt; is a great alternative for flow analytics and is built on the well traveled and robust &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/start?ultron=[EL]-[B]-[AMER]-US+CA-Exact&amp;amp;blade=adwords-s&amp;amp;Device=c&amp;amp;thor=elastic%20stack&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuKC5xefB5AIVCYnICh0wEg5lEAAYASAAEgIp_fD_BwE&#34;&gt;ElasticStack&lt;/a&gt;, meaning, its back end is well documented, well supported, and scales exceptionally well. For those that would like to play around with this but don&amp;rsquo;t want to take the time to install it (see below for the instruction set I used), I have provided a simple VM to toy around with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-07-at-11.00.35-PM-1024x704.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included here is a vanilla Ubuntu 18 LTS VM with a basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow&#34;&gt;Elastiflow&lt;/a&gt; install. This includes all of the components of an ElasticStack plus the front end pieces of the ElastiFlow project. Most of the install is based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.catapultsystems.com/blogs/install-elastiflow-on-ubuntu-18-04-part-1/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; how-to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in the image is also a base install of NGINX and certbot so that you can reverse proxy the access and have a valid SSL certificate. There are a plethora of guides on how to accomplish that task on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was build and validated on Proxmox 6.0.6 but should be able to run on VMWare as well with a bit of qemu-img conversion. As expected, ElastiFlow (and ElasticStack) are fairly resource hungry. 16G of Memory and a handful of CPU cores is the bare minimum to run this with any real efficiency. Additionally, Ubuntu 18 has changed how the networking is setup - it is all located in /etc/netplan/ now.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login Information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;User Name: root
Password: elastiflow
Privileged user: elastiflow
Password: elastiflow  

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.255.255.5/27
2001:db8:ffff:2::5/64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>The BGP conundrum</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-bgp-conundrum/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 02:15:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-bgp-conundrum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BGP. It’s that magical protocol that runs the internet. For for as much as BGP is a fundamental, critical, irreplaceable part of the core functioning of the internet, it is a protocol that has not aged well as far as security is concerned. See, BGP was born when the internet was really still an academic experiment. Handshakes and loose agreements were totally fine for connecting a new site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the awakening. &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Awakening.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Awakening&#34; title=&#34;Awakening.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the internet was used for more critical things, security was obviously more important. But BGP did not really evolve at the same rate - and more importantly, the security model surrounding it was mostly left behind. The reasons aren&amp;rsquo;t really important, but the fallout absolutely is. Retrofitting security into an externally exposed protocol is demonstrably difficult. It has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8205&#34;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6810&#34;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-sa-grow-maxprefix-00.html&#34;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.radb.net/&#34;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt;. The real limit in this space exists because of the nature of the protocol itself - it is external in nature, thereby requiring coordination between multiple parties. The mechanics of this are two fold: personal interaction to agree on the peering, and technical compliance for the protocol to adhere to the agreed upon policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical limitations imposed by vendors and hardware limits have plagued this space for decades. However, the real problem, as with most things technical, is actually the people. A reluctance to agree on methodology, a refusal to spend the time to work out the procedures, an inability or lack of resources for understanding the steps necessary, an unwillingness (intentional or unintentional) to help the community further the progress. None of this really matters other than knowing where we can improve. So, to that end, I humbly recommend that all BGP operators read and implement best practices. Much of this is spelled out clearly in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manrs.org/isps/&#34;&gt;MANRS project&lt;/a&gt;, and it should be used as a shining example of community based action that can produce actual demonstrable results. If you’re interested in tools for troubleshooting BGP or better understanding the scope and scale of the DFZ (Default Free Zone), check out a past post I did on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/03/bgp-tools-troubleshooting-and-monitoring-external-routing-in-a-nutshell/&#34;&gt;BGP tools,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2016/05/bgp-rpki-why-arent-we-using-it/&#34;&gt;RPKI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2018/02/strategy-series-view-outside-network/&#34;&gt;visibility outside of your network.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a follow on to the last global BGP blunder, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bcjordo?lang=en&#34;&gt;Jordan Martin&lt;/a&gt; and I talk about the how and the what of the event in this quick &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenetworkcollective.com/2019/06/bgp-blunder/&#34;&gt;Network Collective short take&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s kinda like having RouteExplorer and Arbor Peakflow. They have a decent overlap but *just* enough difference to want both&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DNS - the treasure trove of information your ISP can see</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/dns-the-treasure-trove-of-information-your-isp-can-see/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 10:23:42 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/dns-the-treasure-trove-of-information-your-isp-can-see/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the nature of &lt;a href=&#34;http://fortune.com/2017/11/23/net-neutrality-explained-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters/&#34;&gt;privacy on the internet&lt;/a&gt; has become a very important topic amongst those concerned with the now lack of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed&#34;&gt;net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. The de-facto mechanism for dealing with privacy has been to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34;&gt;SSL all the things&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which I am very much in favor of. What many do not realize, though, is that simply using SSL for the traffic that transits a given ISP still leaves a wealth of thick, rich, delicious personal data still easily available to your ISP to harvest, sell, and do with as they please. This data comes in the form of DNS queries. DNS is the nearly-always-forgotten, crucial aspect of how the internet functions. Without DNS, nothing works. Everything appears broken and manifest as what appears to be a networking problem. ISPs typically provide what is called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/16/difference-authoritative-recursive-dns-nameservers/&#34;&gt;recursive resolver&lt;/a&gt;, which for most people is handed down by a local provider to the customer premise equipment (CPE; usually a modem or optical terminal of some kind) that they install at a residence. This CPE then hands that resolver to your clients that use it to - you guessed it - recursively resolve DNS queries. These queries can be logged and then mined for browsing habits, etc. Anyone that has ever done any network forensics will know straight away that the value of the information contained in DNS query logs is very, very high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that even though a privacy conscious individual is hiding the bulk of their content in SSL, meaning the bulk of what they’re reading, searching for, and doing, is encrypted, the requests for that content or activity is not. For example, an ISP can potentially see that a client is making many, many queries for $onlineshopping.com and begin selling that data to advertisers. If you think they’re not doing this now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/can-verizon-build-a-strong-brand-from-the-bones-of-yahoo-and-aol/&#34;&gt;think again&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, so $bigbadprovider can see your queries. There are a number of pretty good ways to work around this, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net/&#34;&gt;one of my favorite projects&lt;/a&gt; handily deals with one of them with great simplicity. What I am referring to is the newly popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://scotthelme.co.uk/securing-dns-across-all-of-my-devices-with-pihole-dns-over-https-1-1-1-1/&#34;&gt;DNS over HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;, which is supported by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://one.one.one.one/&#34;&gt;cloudflare 1.1.1.1 service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as a thought experiment I decided to play Reeses Peanut butter and chocolate with two of my favorite technological creations: the aforementioned PiHole, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://zerotier.com/&#34;&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/a&gt;. Now anyone that isn’t familiar with ZeroTier, you should acquaint yourself - Packet Pushers did a good &lt;a href=&#34;https://packetpushers.net/podcast/pq-134-meet-zerotier-open-source-networking/&#34;&gt;podcast on it back in November of 2017&lt;/a&gt;. It’s functionally an encrypted overlay supporting dual stack networking with auto configuration and gateway capabilities, and it runs on almost everything. I love this overlay technology and have been using it for a while - highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to my peanut butter and chocolate experiment. So, given that I had an existing ZeroTier network and an existing PiHole setup at home, I went over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7692870&#34;&gt;Vultr.com&lt;/a&gt; and spun up a small VM for $3.50/mo, integrated it into my fleet with my Ansible and Salt tools, and installed ZeroTier and Pihole. From there I set up this DNS hierarchy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vS-DsmzNWvE335KZtNo6AHX3SySG-VQWhK7i9sNgT6mFMHC5VzRWtMuJg5JraU2dJTFQT4QIGnfaMFP/pub?w=960&amp;amp;h=720&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this buys me is a fully encrypted DNS path up through the Vultr.com VM host without modifying the underlying DNS transport. And it works surprisingly well. I ran SmokePing from two hosts - both leveraging ZeroTier to do their testing, one on my local network and one in the cloud - to measure latency for a few days before I did this and kept that running after the deployment. Now, it’s not perfect but my family and I have been using this for about a month with minimal issues. Once in a great while we’ll see some slow DNS resolution time, but overall it works fairly well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Resolver-Queries.png&#34; alt=&#34;Resolver Queries&#34; title=&#34;Resolver Queries.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My take &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of using a public resolver kinda bothers me, I realize it’s probably unfounded, but I know how to and have run resolvers for ISPs and organizations for like 20 years, so I have the burden of knowledge about what is in the logs and how to run my own. Using a secured recursive resolver is simply trading transit privacy for lack of query privacy somewhere else. Then there is the issue of content networks that use DNS queries to take you to the best / topologically closest cache of their content [NOTE: this, along with the forensics data for debugging potential security issues is a &lt;strong&gt;top&lt;/strong&gt; reason that all ISPs should run their own resolvers]. I fully realize that a normal end user running their own resolver is unlikely and that this deployment is a bit overkill. However, as I can demonstrably prove, it works. And it works pretty well. It also has the added bonus of allowing me to have internal DNS resolution of my own hosts and any mobile ZeroTier client. Is it for everyone? No way. Does it prove viability for low/medium traffic use? Sure. The point is really just to get folks thinking about information leaking that they may not have considered. The nature of the internet makes true privacy pretty much impossible, but there are a few ways to make your data a little harder to for companies to compile and capitalize on if you truly don’t want them to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The rush to automation and the IT pendulum</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-rush-to-automation-and-the-it-pendulum/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 14:20:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-rush-to-automation-and-the-it-pendulum/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the venerable &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ipspace.net&#34;&gt;Ivan Pepelnjak&lt;/a&gt; published a very insightful article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ipspace.net/2018/10/why-is-network-automation-such-hot-topic.html&#34;&gt;automation becoming such a popular topic&lt;/a&gt; that was spawned by an email from one of his readers. I found this article to be spot on, and wanted to add a bit of my own opinion into the automation pie, as I have been spending a lot of time on automation as it related to existing networks as well as into SDN based environments. There is a link, and I wanted to explore it a bit more whilst adding a healthy dose of my opinion. A very large part of the automation push is the IT pendulum swing. Like those of us that worked in the burgeoning ISP world, automating was born of necessity. Except - we didn&amp;rsquo;t call it automation. Most of us didn&amp;rsquo;t call it anything, it was sysadmin scripting at worst and full blown orchestration at best. And there were even commercial platforms (see broadband provisioning tools). However, like many of us that were in the early ISP days, at the very least we had some rudimentary programming and scripting skills because we either had to develop them to stay afloat or we came from an early applied computer science background. Those skills, like a lot of other things, also have the pendulum swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;https-media-giphy-com-media-tttkr0wqcuct2-giphy-gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/ttTKR0wqCUCt2/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pendulum&#34;&gt;The pendulum.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the pendulum in terms of computing, as it&amp;rsquo;s the easiest to quantify. Computing went from centralized (i.e. the mainframe) to decentralized (i.e. the desktop PC). Now we&amp;rsquo;re moving back into the &amp;ldquo;centralized&amp;rdquo; model in the push to cloud (ok, that may be a tad different, but conceptually it&amp;rsquo;s the same - work with me). Moving computationally expensive operations out of a single, personal system into a larger resource while reducing the overhead of the end station. Think &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixelbook-RAM-128GB-GA00122-US/dp/B075JSK7TR/ref=sr_1_4_acs_osp_osp19-42c2a08e-2d_2?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1539871559&amp;amp;sr=1-4-acs&amp;amp;keywords=chromebook&amp;amp;tag=crverifiedexp-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=42c2a08e-2d48-4a89-8acb-841bc830f277&amp;amp;linkCode=oas&amp;amp;cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.42c2a08e-2d48-4a89-8acb-841bc830f277&amp;amp;cv_ct_pg=search&amp;amp;cv_ct_wn=osp-search&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-inline&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=qgIuG&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=chromebook&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=OLHr0&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=53b688eb-671a-4acd-886f-dc89fa36d3d2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=4d4ed571-35bf-4be9-860c-7deaa1ce8cc4&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=QNRHZW6VWAWZ13HMDGF7&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B075JSK7TR&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=53b688eb-671a-4acd-886f-dc89fa36d3d2&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=OLHr0&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B075JSK7TR&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-inline&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=chromebook&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=qgIuG&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=QNRHZW6VWAWZ13HMDGF7&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=4d4ed571-35bf-4be9-860c-7deaa1ce8cc4&#34;&gt;Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; or VDI thin client. Dramatic changes do not happen quickly in the networking world, and there are a number of simple reasons why&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean time to replacement is somewhere between 5 and 10 years depending on the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards for networking take &lt;strong&gt;For-ev-er&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even if the time to replace lifecycle is short, the windows for new tech standards, vendor implementation, and knowledge dissemination to occur rarely, if ever, line up. What this means is that new tech is very slow to adopt in the network world. Even I make the mistake of being far too impatient with this process sometimes, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bcjordo?lang=en&#34;&gt;Jordan Marti&lt;/a&gt;n called me out on in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenetworkcollective.com/2018/02/otc-nfd17/&#34;&gt;Network Collective podcast&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago (p.s., it&amp;rsquo;s a fun listen - check it out). Back to automation. As IT changed in non-service providers from a questionable money sink to a potentially critical revenue generating business and communications environment the generalist IT workers slowly morphed into the specialists. Developers, Network Engineers, Systems Engineers, phone system admins, etc. As this occurred, the disciplines fractured and the skillsets refined, and in many cases lost the generalist foundation in trade for a deeply focused skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sdn&#34;&gt;The SDN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade or two of this shift, SDN blows onto the scene. SDN, as it emerges and becomes the new marketing darling of many a start up and huge company alike, promises to destroy boundaries and obsolete basically everything - equipment, skill sets, people, cars, dogs, cats, water, air&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.everything. The issue is that from a few research products that had ground breaking ideas came a monster. As over-hyped, over-marketed, and under developed juggernaut that had a different meaning to anyone you asked. Whole some folks plugged away quietly on &lt;a href=&#34;https://faucet.nz/&#34;&gt;projects that actually wor&lt;/a&gt;k, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34;&gt;experimented&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://esnetupdates.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/esnets-nick-buraglio-leading-scinets-first-sdn-effort-at-sc15/&#34;&gt;deployments meant to function in production&lt;/a&gt;, the marketing machines created more and more hype and delivered only a few promises. This is the far out pendulum swing. Many operators recoiled. Enterprises said &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;, and folks trying to push boundaries with new deployments were saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;wait, let&amp;rsquo;s figure out &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; before we ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Then the pendulum started swinging back. Automation is back, and now there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; and tools, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ipspace.net/Hands-On_Network_Automation&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re centering on a safer alternative that conservative enterprises can deploy safely and without event. We&amp;rsquo;re back to the fundamentals and the basics of what worked long ago - but now we have help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;My take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, I am still believer in the fundamentals that something resembling SDN brings to the table and have been working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://sc18.supercomputing.org/blog/&#34;&gt;significant SDN projects even recently&lt;/a&gt;, including moving our entire office over to FAUCET controlled switches (more on this soon), and a fair amount of work in the segment routing / PCE space. However, I am not a fan of the marketing machine, especially when there is a poverty of useful data to build said marketing from, and said marketing contains an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/&#34;&gt;overabundance of sensational FUD&lt;/a&gt;. New technology needs to be supportable to be deployed, and it happens, very, very slowly. Much like IPv4 to IPv6, Frame Relay to ATM, and circuit switched to packet switched, as SDN technologies become more and more exposed and easier to use, they become &amp;ldquo;just another thing&amp;rdquo;, and that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trouble with Tribbles .....errr NAT</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/trouble-with-tribbles-errr-nat/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As a follow up to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2018/06/nat-discussions/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to dive a little deeper into the world of address translation and to suss out some of the more compelling details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said on many occasions, it pains me to see NAT referenced as a security mechanism. That said, where PNAT can be beneficial is in an overall privacy strategy, however, even that is comparatively low value and given the current state of global IPv4 allocations, arguably a detriment to usability - we’ll get to that - before we do, it is important to understand what ’NAT” as we call it today actually is, and to do that we need to explain all of the types of address translation (yes, there are several). When what was designed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static, or one-to-one NAT&lt;/strong&gt; This is the original and most simple. It is comprised of an internal and corresponding external IP address. Every machine on the network still needs a public IP address for external mapping with this model. It was originally designed to solve the problem NAT was built to address: address translation between two networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic NAT&lt;/strong&gt; This is a bit of a hybrid of static and the next type, NAPT. In this model, a NAT router maintains a set of external IPv4 address and cynically allocates one to internal addressed for outbound communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Address port translation (NAPT)&lt;/strong&gt; This is what most folks will mean when they say “NAT”. Really, this is address masquerading with port translation. This is what is often confused with a security tool, given that it provides a low level of obfuscation from external scanning and “hides” the hosts behind an externally facing address. This mechanism is typically conflated with stateful firewall implementation, which is not inclusive of this implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the enterprise expectation of a modern UTM, NAPT is unfortunately used interchangeably by many security professionals. What NAPT actually buys is a mechanism for obfuscating many hosts to a smaller number of addresses, typically on the same device. By removing a single data reconnaissance vector (scanning of ipv4) you’re actually providing a new one that’s much easier to exploit (state table exhaustion). While it does work to prevent inbound scanning, that’s really all it does other than allow for network and port translation, it should not be expected to provide anything more than simple obscuring of the internal data. NAPT as security is primarily predicated on the notion that your source address is critically important and should be obscured. While this is true to a certain extent, this believe is somewhat antiquated and should be treated as such. Tracking via source address is still completely doable with simple tools, and geolocation is completely available (assuming it is correctly registered) based on the NAPT address. This is true of IPv4 and IPv6. What NAT does accomplish is prevention of scanning and external recon of potentially sensitive systems. That’s it. I would also assert that this over-stated sense of usefulness users a false sense of protection and encourages a relaxed diligence on hardening end hosts. The same level of protection can very easily be accomplished on a public IPv4 or IPv6 prefix with a simple stateful firewall or host based firewall. What NAPT buys is two fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extension of IPv4 resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poor shortcut to resource protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sized appropriately, the expense of this is a very under-stated price tag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sizable cost for right-sized UTM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of the risk of a state table exhaustion DoS event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insecure internal resources, IoT devices, or BYOD nodes that are compromised or vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without proper east-west filtering and a tight egress policy, this sheen of protection becomes significantly less useful. Add in the likelihood of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT&#34;&gt;carrier grade NAT (CGNAT)&lt;/a&gt; due to extreme &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion&#34;&gt;exhaustion of IPv4 resource&lt;/a&gt;, and you compound the limits with additional operational and troubleshooting overhead. IPv6, while the correct next step, does solve a large part of the issues, but not without it’s own [mostly one-time] costs, and given the large uptake in IPv6 from both the client and content perspectives, it would behoove every organization to get their IPv6 strategy sorted and underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My take&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the olden times of winnuke, providing a layer of confusion between the delicious caramel center of your network resource and the dragons of the internet was pretty important. The tracking mechanisms and scanning was mostly thwarted by the thin candy shell of the NAPT device. While this is still a very important aspect in your network architecture and defense in depth strategy, understanding the real risks and true value is important. The belief that NAPT provides your security (or that it is even a security tool at all) is somewhat misguided. With regard to privacy, the real threats lie in the metadata collection, and unless you are high profile or have a highly targeted business or personal footprint, the security incidents are far more nuanced and often happen at higher layers. In addition, lets not forget that a very, very real threat is not from random poking at our externally facing network resources, but in the social engineering attacks that are readily let right in the door. In addition, there are a number of significant risks that NAPT beings to bear based on it’s use of a state table to track IP to port mappings. All of these details need to be considered and continually revisited for relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;further-study&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that this is a very high profile, sensitive, and polarizing subject, additional reading and research is important. A few good white papers detailing shortcomings and misconceptions surrounding NAPT can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.calyptix.com/top-threats/ddos-attacks-101-types-targets-motivations/amp/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://f5.com/resources/white-papers/the-myth-of-network-address-translation-as-security&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenetworkcollective.com/&#34;&gt;The Network Collective&lt;/a&gt; invited me back to discuss privacy in networking. What resulted was a very spicy podcasts that really highlights the complexity of privacy as a concept in today&amp;rsquo;s internet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that RF technologies and what like to call &amp;ldquo;specialty networking&amp;rdquo; are two of my favorite things in the networking space. &lt;strong&gt;Put them together and it is like chocolate and peanut butter!&lt;/strong&gt; Now, some may not consider Field Area Networking (FAN) to be &amp;ldquo;unconventional&amp;rdquo;, but it certainly falls well outside of the space of what is typically traditional enterprise networking. That said, Cisco&amp;rsquo;s FAN briefing at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd17/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day 17&lt;/a&gt; really got me excited and thinking about the alternatives for the IoT space. Other than cellular LTE or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.link-labs.com/blog/what-is-lte-m&#34;&gt;LTE-M&lt;/a&gt;, there are few options for remote IoT devices with limited power draw and bandwidth requirements. So I went down the twisted path of investigating that space, and recently, I recorded a &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenetworkcollective.com/&#34;&gt;Network Collective&lt;/a&gt; short take on the subject, available below. The NFD 17 Cisco FAN briefing that this is based around is also worth a watch - this is really innovative stuff that many of us probably don&amp;rsquo;t think about. &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/253197120&#34;&gt;Cisco Innovations for the Field Area Network with Rupak Chandra&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/sfoskett&#34;&gt;Stephen Foskett&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;nick-s-take&#34;&gt;Nick&amp;rsquo;s take:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we talk about things like cloud migration, automation, orchestration, and security architectures, lets consider the sheer scale of not just IoT networking but the sensor and other industrial networking _&lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; _of the enterprise space. The sheer number of devices to be managed in these spaces is stupefying, and the transport of the data created by these networks as well as the management of the devices and network elements is a non-trivial detail. Building out networks such as a sensor network has a completely different scope and scale than a stereotypical enterprise or even a carrier service provider network. Keeping in mind just the number of hosts things like addressing schema become a critical part of the architecture (spoiler: you&amp;rsquo;re probably not going to be able to scale IPv4). Power and environmental considerations are also not nearly as squishy as they can be in a nice, controlled data center. Considering those data points, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that there is plenty of interesting stuff happening in both the engineering and security areas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strategy Series: Build vs. Buy (sorta)</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/strategy-series-build-vs-buy-sorta/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 22:53:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/strategy-series-build-vs-buy-sorta/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Build vs. buy is an often lamented and always hotly debated question in all aspects of IT, however, if one is able to truly look at all angles the answer is typically straightforward and can be rooted in one simple strategy: don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;don-t-reinvent-the-wheel&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many times we as an industry don&amp;rsquo;t do our homework - we are all guilty of it - and we reinvent a wheel. Make no mistake, there are true reasons to revisit, revise and reinvent. Lets use an example that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buraglio/pfrancid&#34;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buraglio/vdxrancid&#34;&gt;am&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buraglio/alurancid&#34;&gt;fairly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buraglio/sonrancid&#34;&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buraglio/cienarancid&#34;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt;: RANCID &lt;a href=&#34;http://shrubbery.net/rancid/&#34;&gt;RANCID&lt;/a&gt; code is 20+ years old and pretty messy. RANCID3 is a rewrite that in my opinion makes the already confusing ball of Perl, Expect, and shell even more confusing. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ytti/oxidized&#34;&gt;Oxidized&lt;/a&gt; made that process more elegant and arguably more flexible and extensible. That was a good call. Build vs buy is a tough question and as an industry we tend to think about resources in a lopsided way, which further increases that complexity. Resources have always been and will always be finite, and no matter if you build or buy, you are expending your resources. Lets break down the resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the extent of it. Everything else is driven by this. Time coasts money. It costs money in the form of salaries, overtime, downtime, etc. In IT we describe things in terms of uptime. Five 9&amp;rsquo;s is the uptime we strive for. When we have downtime, it costs money in the form of lost income or expense to repair and often both. Salaries are paid based on time, hourly, weekly, monthly, yearly. Employes trade their time for that salary regardless of how it is structured. You pay for resources that make more efficient use of time. Employers often fall into one of two buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to hire FTE (OPEX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to pay vendors (CAPEX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case, but it&amp;rsquo;s very common - and if we conveniently overlook those environments that are jut to conservative to consider OPEX (i.e. they always choose buy and generally fall into the &amp;ldquo;able to pay vendors&amp;rdquo; category), it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to map build vs buy into those models. Can you support running open source or white box solutions, operationally? Will the OPEX actually save you money when compared to the CAPEX changes they require to make happen? Should you pay for an off the shelf solution and hope that the support you buy can address the issues you&amp;rsquo;ll have? [&lt;em&gt;My strong opinion is that they almost never can, but the comfort that they provide to legal departments and C level execs is what they actually purchase&lt;/em&gt;] It is important to note that different environments introduce very different edge cases, and with many highly technical people, these edge cases have a tendency to creep in and drive a large part of our architectures, but it also gives us a veneer over our needs and requirements process that makes it easier to say &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re special and we have hard requirements for not only A and B but also C, D, E and F&amp;rdquo;. C, D, E, and F are likely so edge case that we really don&amp;rsquo;t *need* them. This is where It gets messy and where the hyperscalers have done it right: Say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-3o7btT1T9qpQZWhNlK&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt; Interdomain multicast? Nope. Requirements for full global tables on every device? Nope. If we really ask ourselves if the requirements are actually requirements or if they are simply desirable because they may make things easier or may satisfy a 5-10% use use case, then maybe we should revisit how we&amp;rsquo;re actually developing our needs and requirements. Mapping business (or other strategic) requirements into technology can be difficult, especially if there is no direct correlation to profit or loss. We are a culture of wheel inventors and we embrace it, but 80-85% of the time our wheels can be dead simple and still roll us where we need to go. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we get &amp;ldquo;for free&amp;rdquo; with that is standardization and ease of management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (lower CAPEX). If we look back at history as an example, no sane person wants to run a network that routes AppleTalk, IPX, IPv4, IPv6 and transits DECNet. that sucked. It was too complicated. It was buggy. We simplified it down to IPv[&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and low and behold most of the gear got more stable, configurations got simpler, and networks got easier to run. We should learn from that. Make no mistake, I realize that reinventing wheels to make them roll faster, longer, etc. is called innovation. However, along with our needs and requirements we need to put serious consideration into our business strategy. Is our business to innovate? Are we going to see direct or indirect improvements to CAPEX or OPEX if we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; innovate. Are we factoring in the &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; of the innovation? Where this starts to get even more fuzzy is in the opensource world. In this space &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; can be defined as self supporting, meaning &amp;ldquo;use of opensource products with no formal or contractual support structure&amp;rdquo;, which a very large amount of organizations are very wary of (and many actively avoid). These are all important questions that must be addresses when deciding on the strategy of build vs buy - it&amp;rsquo;s not as straight forward and simple of a question as &amp;ldquo;build or buy&amp;rdquo;, it seems. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a different perspective on a very similar topic, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://rule11.tech&#34;&gt;Russ White&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s (yes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/riw777/&#34;&gt;THAT Russ White&lt;/a&gt;) post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rule11.tech/enterprise-versus-provider/&#34;&gt;Enterprise vs. Provider&lt;/a&gt;. While not entirely similar, it points out that we have problems and solutions, and that knowing what both of those are is critical to success regardless of their ecosystem. This is key. We need to look at the whole picture. &lt;em&gt;My take: We need to look at the entire picture. It&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as one question. Personally I tend to lean more toward build, but for the majority of my career I was in environments that had extremely clued engineers and support staff. Is this for everyone? Nope. Is it a viable option, absolutely. You invest in people or you invest in contracts. I&amp;rsquo;d rather invest in really, really good people. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;When it comes down to innovation, it&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;1. if wheel exists don&amp;rsquo;t build wheel.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;2. If the wheels aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly the shape or size you need, augment the wheels and contribute your augmentations back for review and inclusion in the wheel plans and inventory where possible and appropriate.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;3. If the wheels don&amp;rsquo;t exist, build a wheel and share the plans for the wheel whenever you can.&lt;/em&gt;```
#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if wheel == &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;:
 print(&amp;lsquo;use existing wheel&amp;rsquo;)
 elseif &amp;lsquo;yes, but incomplete&amp;rsquo;:
 print(&amp;ldquo;augment wheel, contribute wheel changes&amp;rdquo;)
 elseif no:
 print(&amp;ldquo;build wheel, share plans&amp;rdquo;)
 print &amp;ldquo;Miller Time&amp;rdquo;

      <title>Strategy Series: How do you view outside of your network?</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/strategy-series-view-outside-network/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/topics/nix4neteng/&#34;&gt;NIX4NetEng&lt;/a&gt; series I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive deep into the world of strategy, and specifically into the strategy of how we look at and operate our networks, the data they generate and the analytics that are available (and often overlooked) in how networks are managed both long term and day-to-day. So, in the spirit of visibility, lets think about how typical networks are monitored. My guess is that you either already know, or will soon realize that v&lt;em&gt;isibility and testing across disparate networks is hard.&lt;/em&gt; This is a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; topic, so sit back, relax, get your feet up and prepare for a magical journey into the fun and fantastical world of network visibility!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/magic-krhB8ydCQiYZq&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m going to glaze over the low hanging fruit of SNMP monitoring - you have all of that right? Yes? Good. No?!?! Shame on you&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;l do another post of some of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librenms.org/&#34;&gt;favorite tools&lt;/a&gt; soon and you can shamefully download them and set them up, head hung low (until they&amp;rsquo;re up monitoring and alerting, at which point you can raise your head up high!). Lets make a very, very bold assumption that you totally understand how your internal network works, you have graphing, up/down statistics, traffic baselines and visibility into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2017/12/what-is-your-netflow-strategy/&#34;&gt;traffic flow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2017/10/configuration-backups-opportunity-automation-management/&#34;&gt;configurations&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have those things you can link to a few options here or wait and I&amp;rsquo;ll circle back around to them in later topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;visibility-and-testing-across-diverse-networks-is-hard&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Visibility and testing across diverse networks is hard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so visibility. &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/day7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt; Any network engineer with some experience under their belt has gotten the problem report of &amp;ldquo;the internet is down&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the internet is slow&amp;rdquo;. Yup, we all know them, we all love them. We even had an internal joke at a previous employer of mine that we could &amp;ldquo;ping the internet&amp;rdquo;, in that we created a CNAME of &amp;ldquo;theinternet&amp;rdquo; for a host that had high uptime.&lt;code&gt;
(~) heelflip $ ping theinternet
PING theinternet (10.142.143.167): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.14.143.167: icmp\_seq=0 ttl=54 time=0.794 ms
64 bytes from 10.14.143.167: icmp\_seq=1 ttl=54 time=0.768 ms
64 bytes from 10.14.143.167: icmp\_seq=2 ttl=54 time=0.734 ms
64 bytes from 10.14.143.167: icmp\_seq=3 ttl=54 time=0.732 ms
64 bytes from 10.14.143.167: icmp\_seq=4 ttl=54 time=0.758 ms
64 bytes from 10.14.143.167: icmp\_seq=5 ttl=54 time=0.761 ms
&lt;/code&gt;Right, so you get the internal network. What about when you get to the part that you don&amp;rsquo;t control and can&amp;rsquo;t see into? That&amp;rsquo;s harder, but rest easy - there are a number of ways to go about gathering the necessary details. What should those data sources be? Let me throw down what I think are important to track to really understand what the heck is going on outside of your AS or sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paths to common destinations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://google.com&#34;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.servicenow.com&#34;&gt;servicenow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.salesforce.com&#34;&gt;SalesForce)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route table for all peerings (if taking more than default and are using eBGP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency statistics from your site to common destinations (see 1.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency statistics from outside of your network to your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency (and possibly throughput) statistics to intermediary points across your typical paths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External route table and path statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packet loss statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a decent amount of data. How can this be done? Well, let me tell you, there are a few ways but drawing them all together can be a daunting task. This can be accomplished by looking at data produced by &lt;a href=&#34;https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/&#34;&gt;smokeping&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/perfsonar/owamp&#34;&gt;owamp&lt;/a&gt; with an SNMP graphing tool for interface stats and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bgpmon.net/&#34;&gt;BGPMon&lt;/a&gt; and Peermon for BGP information. An opensource product called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perfsonar.net/&#34;&gt;perfSonar&lt;/a&gt; rolls a lot of this together, but there are commercial packages such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thousandeyes.com/&#34;&gt;ThousandEyes&lt;/a&gt; that offer these types of statistics across a large swath of the internet as well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://atlas.ripe.net/&#34;&gt;RIPE ATLAS&lt;/a&gt; has a great deal of statistics that can be easily queried  and has a large install base too. If you are a savvy coder you can grab some good information from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/api/v2/manual/&#34;&gt;RIPE ATLAS API&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources, capability, or time to do that then there is an option for a turnkey solution. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thousandeyes.com&#34;&gt;ThousandEyes&lt;/a&gt; has a strong offering and there is a great deal of information that they gather. They also have very good presence and availability of information about their product, most recently presenting at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/thousandeyes-presents-at-networking-field-day-17/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day 17&lt;/a&gt; (and historically at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/thousandeyes-presents-at-networking-field-day-6/&#34;&gt;NFD 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/thousandeyes-presents-at-networking-field-day-8/&#34;&gt;NFD 8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/thousandeyes-presents-at-networking-field-day-12/&#34;&gt;NFD 12).&lt;/a&gt;I was a delegate at NFD 17 and was pleased to see another tool that provides visibility into BGP, a very often overlooked and yet unbelievablycritical and useful viewpoint which has historically been difficult to see outside of tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2015/03/opendns-acquires-bgpmon-and-the-future-of-route-monitoring/&#34;&gt;BGPMon&lt;/a&gt;. (see my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/topics/nix4neteng/&#34;&gt;NIX4NetEng&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/03/bgp-tools-troubleshooting-and-monitoring-external-routing-in-a-nutshell/&#34;&gt;post about BGP visibility&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/netbeez-presents-at-networking-field-day-9/&#34;&gt;NetBeez&lt;/a&gt; also has a reasonable offering but last I have looked it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do much outside of a network (admittedly I may be behind the curve with their product). If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing or hearing some more about these products, I did a packet pushers podcast on perfSonar a few years ago which is dated as far as feeds and speeds, but still very relevant today, you can read the show notes and listen &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/show-163-open-source-perfsonar-finds-the-flaws-impacting-the-flows/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; For more info on ThousandEyes you can check out the latest &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd17/&#34;&gt;NFD17&lt;/a&gt; videos.   The real point is that to really see the performance of your network and to fully understand the true user experience you need to have total visibility into the entire ecosystem, not just the pieces that you can control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strategy Series: What is your netflow strategy?</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/what-is-your-netflow-strategy/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 11:15:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/what-is-your-netflow-strategy/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;You have one, right? Even if your entire strategy is “collect some flow data”, there is absolutely NO reason not to have a netflow implementation, and frankly, it will save you time and money over time if you make the effort to do it. I love network data and analytics and I have waxed poetic about how important they are at every opportunity. There are a myriad of options for analytics and flow data. If you’re not doing something, you’re doing it wrong. I can go on and on about the importance of network data for budgeting, security, capacity planing, and general knowledge of what your network is actually doing, but that’s for another day (contact me directly if you really want to chat details on that subject). Today is about network flow data - the foundational bits and pieces of what the heck your network, big or small, is actually doing. I’ve been having a breakdance fight with flow data packages for almost two decades, and I’ve jotted down a few of my more notable experiences. Regardless of your needs, budget, abilities, or time, there is a solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/breakin-boogaloo-shrimp-11FirB7GcukiwU&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arbor-https-www-arbornetworks-com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arbornetworks.com/&#34;&gt;Arbor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arbor is the Rolls Royce of flow analytics (and DDoS mitigation) solutions. It does almost everything, has options for managed objects, DDoS scrubbing and alerting capabilities, a magnificent interface, role based access, rainbows and gumdrop houses with lollipop trees. This system is pretty darned amazing - it truly is, and that likely comes from the fact that they were one of the first, and had/have one of the largest install bases for this kind of system. They have turnkey solutions and have the unique position of being in roughly 90% of the worlds legacy tier 1 ISPs, so their DDoS and other security options are strong, fast to update, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; good. I’ve had great experience with this platform and its API. I like to think of arbor as the commercial ISP brass ring for flow data analytics. They have other solutions for enterprise and campus, but their roots are in strong ISP solutions. They’re pricey, but very, very good. Expect to need at least an FTE to really take full advantage of their very capable ecosystem, but if you dedicated the money and manpower to it, you won’t be sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;splunk-https-www-splunk-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splunk.com/&#34;&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know spunk as a really nice log and analytic system but what many may not realize is that Splunk is really, really good at network data and analytics as well. It’s pricey, but it’s as close as you’ll get to a turkey solution for a SIEM that can actually scale. It has the notion of customizable dashboards and visualization, as a huge amount of plugins and add on’s, but they come with a legendarily steep price tag. The saying I have always heard is “if you can afford spunk, buy spunk. If you can’t use an ELK stack (noe elastic stack)”. My experience backs this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;elk-elastic-stack-https-www-elastic-co&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/&#34;&gt;ELK /Elastic Stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of this not only because it’s essentially free, but because it’s so extremely flexible and has so many existing projects built around it. I’ve moved my go-to for net flow collection from nfdump to Elastic Stack built around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manitonetworks.com/about-flow-analyzer/&#34;&gt;Manito Networks flowanalyzer&lt;/a&gt; install.   This platform takes a bit more command line jockeying and isn’t entirely turnkey, but it’s crazy flexible, had great eye candy and building the visualizations and dashboards is easy. Notable mention is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow&#34;&gt;Elastiflow&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar but has a bit more eye candy and leverages log stash. Elastiflow doesn’t have nearly as turnkey of an install (and really has almost no “newbie” install instructions at all - but it’s a strong offering if you already know how to spin up an ELK stack and tune it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nfdump-http-nfdump-sourceforge-net&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nfdump.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Nfdump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venerable nfdump. This is what so many large networks were using (and probably still are) for their raw flow collections. This package scales exceptionally well to huge networks and has so many tools available for the CLI that it’s the de facto standard for raw flow analytics and forensics. I love this system and ran it for many, many, MANY years. It takes a but of time to learn, and may not be the right tool for you if you want a modern GUI, lots of eye candy, or are inexperienced with the UNIX/LINIX command line, but it’s got it where it counts, supports IPFix, Netflow v5, v9 and IPFIX and you can’t dog wrong with it. I have a handy how-to getting it up and running Under CentOS &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/01/install-nfsen-and-nfdump-on-centos-6-5-for-netflow-and-or-sflow-collection/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When you couple this with something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JustinAzoff/flow-indexer&#34;&gt;Justin Azoff’s flow indexer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.net/projects/nfsen/&#34;&gt;nfsen&lt;/a&gt; on the front end, you’ve got an enviable power user setup ripe for both forensics, tactical work as well as baseline generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;solarwinds-https-www-solarwinds-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.solarwinds.com/&#34;&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solarwinds Orion is the go-to for windows based monitoring. It’s not cheap, but if you’re running a windows based monitoring system, you’re likely an enterprise and have budget for it. I have been impressed with the visualizations of this system and like that it does all of the monitoring in one package - once installed I never have to see windows (and since I can’t efficiently support windows, that’s probably a good thing - someone else will handle the OS work). The price tag can be a bit steep depending on number of nodes monitored, but it does what it claims and commercial support is decent. My one complaint is that I can’t seem to find a way to do raw data queries in a straightforward way. This may be possible and I have just not had the time or mental power to workout out. Overall it’s a worthy monitoring platform if you need your system to run on windows and can afford it. There are some older but still good videos from several Network Field Day events &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/companies/solarwinds/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I wrote about it from a UNIX users perspective &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/2015/07/solarwinds-orion-from-a-unix-user-point-of-view/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-action-networks-live-ux-https-www-liveaction-com-products-live-ux&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.liveaction.com/products/live-ux/&#34;&gt;Live Action Networks Live UX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another commercial option that has good support and a lot of eye candy. This was born out of work with the US Government and is a really interesting system. I’ve met with these guys several times and their team is super open to taking and feature requests and they have a good product. I first heard about them at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/appearance/liveaction-presents-at-networking-field-day-7/&#34;&gt;Network Field day 7&lt;/a&gt;, their product was intriguing there and they’ve come a long way since then. Worth looking at for a turnkey solution for things like network analytics, IP-SLA,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-take&#34;&gt;My take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the power that an indexed set of data provides and I am willing and capable of plowing through the install of a linux based system. I’m also frugal, and for a product to really warrant my money it needs to do something that nothing else does [translated: I am willing and able to support open source solutions].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot-2017-12-15-20.32.57.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the Manito Networks install of Elk + Kibana (no logstash in this default install) is where I typically land due to the fact that I can get indexed flow data, nice, configurable graphs and trending statistics, and can integrate things like syslog into another index on the same system giving me the tools to do forensics on a number of topics on that system. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/thart/flowanalyzer/blob/master/Install/README.md&#34;&gt;The setup is crazy easy&lt;/a&gt; and really well documented, too. Someone linux-inclined can have it up and collecting flow data (sflow, netflow v5/9 or IPFIX) in an order of about 30 minutes - probably less. The take aways really, though, is that there are options available no matter your skill level or budget, so there is really no reason not to have something.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No privacy may be the new privacy.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/no-privacy-may-new-privacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2017 18:06:01 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/no-privacy-may-new-privacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking politics and putting them aside, what the new administration has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/technology/congress-moves-to-strike-internet-privacy-rules-from-obama-era.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;been attempting to change&lt;/a&gt; with regard to internet privacy is something we should &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; be informed about. Wether you have a tin foil hat or don&amp;rsquo;t care, &amp;ldquo;knowing is half the battle&amp;rdquo;. The other half is doing - which I will also lend some brief insight to (sorta). What&amp;rsquo;s changing? Nothing yet (as of the time of this writing). What will likely change? The ability of your internet (mobile or not) to sell your browsing habits and personal usage data. What does this mean? Well, it means that if you visit facebook, amazon, JC Penny, or buy-adult-toys.com a lot, that information can be sold to advertisers, private companies, etc., etc. &amp;ldquo;But I use SSL, I&amp;rsquo;m safe&amp;rdquo;. Nope. DNS query data - the requests made for a domain name like google.com, used to map a name to an IPvX address - that can be sold too. The content of the browsing is great, but the knowledge that a site was visited is just as useful&amp;hellip;and this data is generated not just by traditional &amp;ldquo;browsing&amp;rdquo;, everything that touches the internet uses it. Apps, Games, everything. Removing these rules also means that there is no oversight into how this collection can be done, what kind of data - sensitive or not - can be collected and sold and to whom. That&amp;rsquo;s what deregulation looks like, folks.&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/personal.info_.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/personal.info_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; What does this mean for the average internet user like, say, my Mom or Dad? It means that when they look at ANYTHING online, it&amp;rsquo;s likely going to be collected, indexed, data mined, and then sold to be further data mined and then these users will get targeted for a barrage of advertising. Worse yet, this data is ripe for misuse. What if the data is compromised? Sorry. That&amp;rsquo;ll suck for sure. Even worse that than, what if that data is used by nation states? What if it&amp;rsquo;s misinterpreted? It&amp;rsquo;s a mess. Has this data been used in this manner in the past? Sure. All of the providers use it internally. &lt;a href=&#34;http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/25/technology/yahoo-verizon-deal-sale/&#34;&gt;Verizon bought yahoo&lt;/a&gt; for this reason.  The real issue is that most people do not understand what all of this means. Since the internet is a completely traceable environment in 99.999% of cases, unlike really anything prior, this is paramount. What can you do? Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re not technical, good luck. Perhaps if this happens it will spark a new industry of private overlays like Tor to be commercialized and widely adopted. Wait with the FCC leaning toward rolling back net neutrality those services could likely be slowed or blocked completely. Sorry. On the fringes are the mom-and-pop ISPs - they still exist. WISPs, small and rural providers. These are less likely to be the safest bet in the future should this come to pass. Mobile metadata - what will generate the majority of the controversy - is likely to be the most often sold because there will be such a diverse and deep pool of data. Another of the side effects is this could potentially be an even higher adoption of SSL, which is good, but may also lead to a higher adoption of the vile SSL decryption practice. Lets hope not. What will I do? Not sure. I have extensive experience running DNS servers and VPNs. I may just start connecting to one of my VPS devices and run everything over OpenVPN from both mobile and traditional connections. There are some super simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn&#34;&gt;docker how-tos&lt;/a&gt; out there that Ive used in the past. VPS service are cheap, I have a few but my &lt;a href=&#34;https://prgmr.com/xen/&#34;&gt;prgmr.com&lt;/a&gt; VPS is my favorite. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to tunnel IPv6 too. Welcome to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BGP RPKI - why aren&#39;t we using it more?</title>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/bgp-rpki-why-arent-we-using-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;nav&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#image-created-from-surfnet-rpki-page&#34;&gt;Image created from SURFNet RPKI page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     I was recently at a meeting where BGP RPKI was the topic de jour. While this has been a topic that I have visited on occasion of the last few years and something I wanted to spend significant time on, I have found that setting aside the time has been difficult and sparse, much like the deployment of BGP RPKI. In order to better understand the options available, it&amp;rsquo;s important to break down the pieces and terminology involved; BGP is daunting enough to those unfamiliar with it and adding PKI on top of that can be even more so. So, what are these bits and pieces and why have we not done more to adopt it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BGP&lt;/strong&gt; - the venerable and foundational protocol that quite literally runs the internet. BGP allows an organization to announce and exchange it’s IPv4 and IPv6 resources with other organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Public Key Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/&#34;&gt;ARIN&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Using cryptographically verifiable certificates, RPKI allows IP address holders to specify which Autonomous Systems (AS&amp;rsquo;s) are authorized to originate their IP address prefixes. These statements, known as Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), allow network operators to make informed routing decisions, and help secure Internet routing in general. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROA&lt;/strong&gt; - Route Origin Authorizations - Who is authorized to originate or source these prefixes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROV&lt;/strong&gt; - Route Origin Validation - Can we validate, cryptographically, that the origin of this resource (for example, 8.8.8.8) is authorized to originate or source these prefixes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Many of the details of RPKI are actually not even technical, both with ARIN and with vendors, there exists complications that make the technical pieces look like child’s play. Legality of the licensing and housing of authoritative certificates are complicated, shrouded in legalese due to the nature of what they represent. This proves to be a show stopper for a lot of older organizations that have grandfathered address space and may not have gone through the ARIN agreement process any time in the recent past [note: supposedly this process is required for ARIN IPv6 space, so most of that _should_ be covered. Other regions may have easier, lower hurdles - I’ve heard good things about RIPE’s process - but I have no experience with it. The legal issues with contracts and signing certificates may also prove to be troublesome to enterprises, most of which are very conservative and slow to adopt anything new ::cough:: IPv6 ::cough::.  Certificate generation and maintenance is also considered difficult in many cases, the details can be confusing and the documentation overwhelming or difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of those non-technical issues, platforms with large install bases are sparsely supported - although this is changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     There have been a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bgpmon.net/large-scale-bgp-hijack-out-of-india/&#34;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bgpmon.net/large-hijack-affects-reachability-of-high-traffic-destinations/&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt;, high profile route hijacks. If you’re ever curious to see what they were, BGPMon typically has a post-mortem shortly after they occur. This is a big deal. There are a number of ways they could have been prevented, too one of which is BGP RPKI. Is that worth the overhead? I think anyone that has had to scramble to figure out what was going on during one of these events would argue yes. But even with that, we have minimal adoption. With the significant movement to cloud based work, enterprises, service providers, academic institutions and even savvy end users should ask themselves a few important questions before doing your risk analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your cloud providers do RPKI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your upstream service provider or peering partner honor invalid routes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your upstream service provider or peering partner even support prefix or AS-Path filtering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the effect BGP blackhole routing for security filtering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you deal with invalid routes? (alert, set preference, drop, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you handle invalid routes that may be more specific?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why have I not deployed BGP RPKI yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My perspective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Unfortunately, the feeling I get is very similar to that of things [that we actually need] such as IPv6 and DNSSec. Tools that make our resources safer,  but are often overlooked due to increased operational complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really about risk analysis: Is the risk of not having this worth the effort of maintaining it?  Since we [as an internetworking ecosystem] been clear in our actions that necessary things as obvious and straightforward as appropriate prefix filtering and IPv6 deployment are in many cases above and beyond, it should come as no surprise that adding complexity on top of “stuff that just works” is’t happening on a large scale. Even with repeated proof that changes would alleviate risk, we don’t do it because what we have has been deemed “good enough”* and change is scary and hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we need? We need tools. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpki.surfnet.nl/&#34;&gt;RPKI dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that SURFnet has available is a fantastic example of an easy to use tool that makes a ton of information available. We need a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very easy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; way to deploy this. BGP is actually a pretty simple protocol to make work, which is why is hasn’t changed much in the  extremely long tenure it has had as foundation of the internet. We need a very, very straightforward way to get the non-technical pieces done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This is just the tip of the iceberg and I am but a novice with this tech - but my gut feelings are typically right about this type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &amp;ldquo;Good enough” is almost never good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buzzwords, technology, terminology, and the interconnection of modern networking</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/buzzwords-technology-terminology-interconnection-modern-networking/</link>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/buzzwords-technology-terminology-interconnection-modern-networking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m way overdue for a soapbox session &amp;ndash; I found this one in my drafts and thought it was something I needed to put out there. It&amp;rsquo;s already dated in terminology but that actually helps make the point - it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep up. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets throw this out there: social media can be exhausting. Do not misunderstand me, it’s a great tool for communication, obtaining and disseminating information as well as standard goofing around. It’s also a serious business for a huge amount of companies. I use it extensively myself and I’ll assume there is a pretty good chance you followed a tweet or other social media link to get here. However, for a green network engineer looking for a path forward it can be a bit daunting. Those my age never had the social media aspect to deal with when we were learning, we may have had IRC or other haphazard back channels to bounce ideas and questions, but for the most part, the resources were far more limited than they are today. In actuality, I believe that this was a bit of an advantage that we had over today: we were often forced to bulldoze through problems, making mistakes that taught us deep understandings of the inner working of that given technology. It also sucked a lot more [time].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I right? Maybe. Maybe not. Who is to say? These days I take full advantage of the wealth of information that is the internet for both personal and professional tasks, I would be a tad crazy not to. It&amp;rsquo;s why I write the tech stuff I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that, though, comes so many buzzwords and so much hype that it is very easy for an aspiring network engineer (or any professional IT hopeful, student or casual techie) to become completely overwhelmed by simply looking at twitter and following a handful of key players. I’ve been doing what I do with networks since the 1990s and even I have been feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of “Network Engineer Killer” or “Must know” technologies being thrown around in the last few years. It&amp;rsquo;s both exciting, encouraging and at the same time enough to make even the most grizzly engineer feel snowed under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait for it……Cloud. No wait, DevOps. Containers! NO! NO! SDN! They&amp;rsquo;re all cool and they&amp;rsquo;re all important. They are also a lot to take in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a great deal about DevOps and SDN lately. Being a really, really bad developer, DevOps is a tad uncomfortable for me. It is an obviously useful skill set: Understanding code and automation. It’s powerful and &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; make your professional life easier. Do you need to obsess over it? Probably not (do you need to obsess over any of it?!?). Remember that internet thing that I mentioned before? Yeah, there are a lot of resources there. Search engines are your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you need to know the concepts? For sure. Guess what, though? There are a &lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt; of resources for that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was brainstorming this, I mind-mapped some of the things that jumped into my brain [&lt;a href=&#34;https://mindnode.com/&#34;&gt;mindnode pro&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic app for this, I highly recommend it]. Things that get a lot of attention and maybe deserve a cursory glance. Lets break them down in a simple-ish and concise-ish manner and understand that by the time of this writing I’m positive it will be outdated and there will be some new whiz-bang thing that the marketing machine will be saying is the “something-killer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the high level things I see thrown around a lot. For what it’s worth, OpenDayLight has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opendaylight.org/project/technical-overview&#34;&gt;a page&lt;/a&gt; with some definitions that is pretty good, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Tech-Relationships.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Networking-Tech-Relationships.png&#34; alt=&#34;Networking Tech Relationships&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; all-encompassing and is likely missing major things, however, the point is really not to be accurate as much as it is to demonstrate that there is a &lt;strong&gt;monumental&lt;/strong&gt; amount of scope that is in some ways interconnected and in other ways completely autonomous. It is also pretty clear that due to the nature of what “DevOps” is, it has ties into many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest take-away is that the communication paths need to be there - Better communication between these specializations makes for better, more secure, more usable tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is how the DevOps is done, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what it is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am really getting at here is that there is no need to get overwhelmed. You don’t need to know all of this stuff. If you know a little about most of it and a lot about one or two topics, then in my opinion you are doing really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best advice to any new IT person is not to know everything but to know where to find it - and then share what you learned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Interdomain SDN part 3</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-interdomain-sdn-part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 04:37:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/building-interdomain-sdn-part-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34;&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/01/sdn-across-the-wan-part-deux-primitives/&#34;&gt;interdomain SDN&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, work is being done, smart people are thinking about it and building ways to make it a reality. Not being one to give up on an idea, I gave &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1anAaqWR8wmzKO5fqidDy9QJXW4RiVshX9Miq3PoDv9E/edit&#34;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt; in may at &lt;a href=&#34;http://chinog.org/meetings/chi-nog-05/&#34;&gt;ChiNOG&lt;/a&gt;  on what my take on what that architecture should be. I (we) propose that the use of existing protocols such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5575&#34;&gt;BGP FlowSpec&lt;/a&gt; will make this realistically deployable and maintainable given some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dwcarder/sdn-ix-demo&#34;&gt;simple, pluggable middleware&lt;/a&gt;. As work continues to happen on this, my belief is that this is a very sound (and simple) concept. The middleware is modular and flexible enough that it can stand alone or plug into an existing code base such as ODL or Ryu. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc15blog.blogspot.com/2015/11/simplifying-worlds-most-powerful.html&#34;&gt;I work on the SDN deployment&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sc15.org&#34;&gt;annual international supercomputing conference&lt;/a&gt;, and work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.es.net/network-r-and-d/workshops/&#34;&gt;SDN for scientific networking workshop&lt;/a&gt;,  I become more and more convinced that there needs to be an operationally viable and simple way to support these types of networks in ways that are thin and simple since it is a newer concept and some of the protocols involved (e.g. OpenFlow) is still in its infancy.  Here is the video of the talk for anyone interested in listening to me talk about it for 20 minutes. As a reference, this is a great talk from the same conference on BGP FlowSpec that adds a lot of credence to the use of it as a policy dissemination protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solarwinds Orion from a UNIX user perspective</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/solarwinds-orion-from-a-unix-user-point-of-view/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 04:08:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/solarwinds-orion-from-a-unix-user-point-of-view/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in February of this year (2015) I was introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.solarwinds.com/&#34;&gt;Solarwinds&lt;/a&gt; when they presented to us at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/&#34;&gt;Networking Field day 9&lt;/a&gt;. Until then I knew of SolarWinds products but only at a cursory level; I had never really seen or used their stuff since it was mostly focused on environments that were either smaller or outside of the networking world that I generally operate in. However, I am a[n insufferable] network monitoring &amp;ldquo;aficionado&amp;rdquo; so when the opportunity to play around with it arose, I happily took it. Now, let me preface what comes next by laying out a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not a fan of SNMP. In fact, I hate it. It&amp;rsquo;s the least intuitive, overly complex protocol used for management that we can&amp;rsquo;t get away from. It sucks and is CPU intensive. It is cryptic, dated and we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to fix it by bolting on crude, poorly supported security features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t do windows systems. I have not managed as much as a windows desktop other than an on-demand VM for the occasional DWDM network element manager since 1999. I have no issue with it as a platform but a unix based platform is a better tool for my every day workflow (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forwardingplane.net/topics/nix4neteng/&#34;&gt;NIX4NetEng&lt;/a&gt;)  so I don&amp;rsquo;t have it in my wheelhouse and have no business managing such a system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went into this project completely and totally open minded. These were the canvas, brushes and subject I had to work with and it needed to do what needed done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, my impressions of SolarWinds Orion platform at first glance were: &amp;ldquo;Wow, this is pretty good&amp;rdquo;.&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-10.48.05-PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 10.48.05 PM&#34; /&gt; I must admit, I was surprised. Although I went in open minded, I knew that Orion is a tool that seemed to be enterprise focused, which was not the application it was being used for. It runs on windows systems, it had &amp;ldquo;rumored&amp;rdquo; scaling issues in large environments, and they market it mostly to the enterprise demographic, at least from my point of view. Admittedly I struggled with the configuration. I&amp;rsquo;m a little old school and I like to kick the tires of a GUI and then to most of the heavy lifting in a conf file or set of files using VI, which I was not able to do here. I found the management a little clunky and sluggish at times, but the data presentation was top shelf and once I figured out the where and how I was able to set up netflow, syslog collection and up/down monitoring in pretty short order. In this environment I didn&amp;rsquo;t yet have IPv6 so no sflow or IPFIX in the mix yet; not sure about IPv6 support in practice. A rough breakdown of the pros and cons from my inaugural run: &lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elegant Interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eye candy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One stop shop***&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good support for common stuff, seems expandable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great &lt;a href=&#34;https://thwack.solarwinds.com&#34;&gt;community of support&lt;/a&gt;; very &amp;ldquo;FOSS-Like&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of knobs and dials for tuning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I say good interface?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated netflow database maintenance is cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for flows and syslogs is reasonably fast. - a litmus test for real use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s SNMP. We&amp;rsquo;re mostly stuck with that, unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface configuration took a little getting used to coming from a CLI background (this is a &amp;ldquo;me problem&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost; it&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably noticeable capital expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknowns: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to play with the SNMP trap management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kept RANCID for configurations management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key for this for me was that I did not need to manage the server. I had no access whatsoever to the underlying OS, meaning the responsibility of managing this host OS was completely off the table. I was able to manage the SolarWinds instance from its web interface without issue. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-10.47.36-PM.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-10.47.36-PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2015-07-06 at 10.47.36 PM&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My summary: If you are comfortable in a windows environment or do not manage the underlying system, don&amp;rsquo;t need granular flow and syslog analysis for forensics and have the cash, it&amp;rsquo;s a full featured, supported platform. I continue to learn more and more about the seemingly endless stuff this platform can do. If you are strapped for cash and/or are comfortable going the FOSS route, you have a lot of options at the expense of configuration time and possible learning curve. You&amp;rsquo;ll spend the money wither way, either on people time or on licensing. In some cases possibly both. ** I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that as a rumor. In my experience with the devices and other network elements it managed it seemed to work pretty well and I had no scaling issues. *** Depends heavily on needs and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ravello Systems review and use case study</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/ravello-systems-review-and-use-case-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2015 16:42:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/ravello-systems-review-and-use-case-study/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a vast number of entities that offer the seemingly ubiquitous “cloud”. “SaaS”, “IaaS”, “BLAHaaS”, buzzword compliance is truly a sought after thing by marketing folks. With the proliferation of virtualization, containers and other “time slicing” of hardware by software the chatter can quickly become noise. As technical professionals and the warm bodies with the responsibility for actually making things work and keeping them running, the onus is on us to be able to decipher the useful from the fluff. A staggeringly large number of institutions, enterprise, education, research, and government all rely heavily on virtualization as a cornerstone for cost savings and operational ease. This makes sense, there is real cost savings in both operational and capital money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ravellosystems.com/&#34;&gt;Ravello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was given access to an interesting emerging product brought about by the original developers of the venerable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page&#34;&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt;. Ravello offers something new, something a bit different and something potentially useful for a number of different applications. Ravello is essentially a cloud overlay. I find the interfaces for both the Amazon EC2 and Google compute engine clunky and unintuitive from an operational perspective. While APIs are decent, I am a poor developer and really have no desire to write code to their APIs. When I need results now, I want compatibility and a good interface and I’ll wager most other operational folks do too. This is an element that is hard to acheive and where I was a tad surprised by the Ravello platform. The interface for their cloud overlay was quite elegant and &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; intuitive. That’s important. However, what it actually does is more significant. The Ravello overlay allows a VM admin to import an existing image in its native form (either VMWare or KVM), deciphers the networking metadata from the images and builds the network for them automatically. This is cool in and of itself, but the real power is the combination of that “admin candy” and the ability to tune the knobs for things like which cloud provider (AWS or GCE) to push your resources to, allow optimization for things like cost or performance and the option to time shutdown of the resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For smaller institutions and enterprises the value seems self evident. As an example, lets say you want to model a change to your data center network which includes an SRX firewall, 3 window servers, 10 linux servers and a load balancer. These resources can all be uploaded into the ravello cloud. It does its best to figure out the network, allowing for some reasonably powerful changes to the configuration right from their interface. Snaphot the entire network from their canvas (which looks like a nice network diagramming tool), make the changes and monitor the result. If it doesn’t work you can roll it back or hack at the consoles of the devices using their VNC based console access to figure out what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the aforementioned benefits, there were some other surprises. The time to provision was quite good, importing at the speed of upload and then fairly quickly deciphering the needed pieces. It is also obviously self service, meaning I can import, enable, tweak and disable within a choice of cloud based hosting services; flexibility is always good, especially when it is well implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall my impression of Revello is that is provides some pretty interesting and useful stuff, especially when considering utilizing it as a lab for testing upgrades, changes, etc. Many small to medium sized environments do not have resources to put into a physical lab, virtualizing it for a fraction f the cost has a lot of merit and value. Overflow for event based demand is also an obvious use case and again ease of use implementation is key.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NetBeez, performance monitoring and the network.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/netbeez-performance-monitoring-and-the-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 05:13:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/netbeez-performance-monitoring-and-the-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/&#34;&gt;Networking Field day 9&lt;/a&gt; there was a great deal of discussion regarding monitoring, modeling, and maintaining networks, as would be expected at an event with such a focus. Luckily for us, an interesting product that comes from a company that I was unfamiliar with called &lt;a href=&#34;http://netbeez.net/&#34;&gt;NetBeez&lt;/a&gt; gave an inspired presentation. Now, NetBeez got my attention for a few reasons. First off, NetBeez is doing some really great things in the field of network monitoring. What would that be, you ask? What is hard about network monitoring? Nothing, I reply. It&amp;rsquo;s just hard to do it right. What they are providing is a number of things, but the most useful, at least for me, is the way their products can provide a perspective from that of a typical user. In doing that, they have brought something power to the table. NetBeez has brought a product model that has existed for some time in a bit of a different form in scientific networking and they&amp;rsquo;ve made it enterprise ready. For those that are not aware of it, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.perfsonar.net/&#34;&gt;perfsonar&lt;/a&gt; project has been providing latency and throughput testing and baseline creation for quite some time and &lt;a href=&#34;https://atlas.ripe.net/&#34;&gt;RIPE ATLAS&lt;/a&gt; has been making available a small probe device that does similar network testing. The difference is that neither are really focused on enterprise. NetBeez saw a need and filled it. With the many options that are available, NetBeez has a test for many of the critical needs of a given network, and in recent releases, they&amp;rsquo;ve offered up a wireless probe which only widens their portfolio. Much like its community platform analogs, the RIPE ATLAS, there are several custom tests available. Unlike the NCC, the devices are yours to configure, i.e. not open by default to test against and self contained within a given administrative environment if necessary, with an on-site dashboard service also available. Custom tests include DNS queries, http, traceroute, ping and iperf. In addition to having a powerful set of test tools in a very easy to use web interface that tracks the statistics over time, providing a nice baseline tool in addition to the obvious troubleshooting tools present. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-03-15-23.32.55.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-2015-03-15-23.32.55.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot 2015-03-15 23.32.55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My quick thoughts: a lack of IPv6 and detailed one and two-way latency test tools leave it outside of what I would personally need, however, NetBeez has IPv6 on their roadmap and they are very open to feature requests. A refreshing artifact that I got from them during our conversations is that they have a target and mean to meet it. They are not attempting to be everything to everyone, but instead are offering very easy to configure, long term monitoring and baseline creation of complicated and distributed enterprise networks. Something useful and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Network Field Day 9</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-9/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2015 15:55:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll have the opportunity to participate in another &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd9/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to attend&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/02/network-field-day-7/&#34; title=&#34;Network Field Day 7&#34;&gt; in the past&lt;/a&gt; and have done some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/network-field-day-5/&#34; title=&#34;Network Field Day 5 – Participate Remotely&#34;&gt;remote participation&lt;/a&gt; when possible, but like some of the other rare &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/scinet-a-privileged-few/&#34; title=&#34;SCinet, a privileged few&#34;&gt;opportunities&lt;/a&gt; I have had in my career, NFD is fairly unique in that it is constantly evolving in both the information provided and the individuals involved. As the saying goes, variety is the spice of life. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited about the presentations and have been looking forward to talking to a few of the participant companies for a while. There is a tight line up for NFD9, but I am very intrigued as I am either unfamiliar or have been looking for more information about several of them for quite some time now. &lt;a href=&#34;http://netbeez.net/&#34;&gt;NetBeez&lt;/a&gt; is  an interesting one, they provide a service not unlike a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with for years called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perfsonar.net/&#34;&gt;perfSonar&lt;/a&gt;. The data that these kind of projects provide is absolutely invaluable, so I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in NetBeez and how they&amp;rsquo;re accomplishing their tasks and presenting their data. I met with and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/04/blending-the-network-pluribus-serverswitch/&#34;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/&#34;&gt;Pluribus Networks&lt;/a&gt; at (and around the time of) &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;NFD7&lt;/a&gt;. I was impressed then and I&amp;rsquo;m impressed now. I see a great value in what they&amp;rsquo;re doing for so many practical applications and am very anxious to see what they&amp;rsquo;ve added, changed or tweaked since our last meeting roughly a year ago. &lt;a href=&#34;http://cumulusnetworks.com/&#34;&gt;Cumulus networks&lt;/a&gt; is another one I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to get lab time with since they came out. I am looking forward to having them in a room, they&amp;rsquo;re doing something to networking that, like Pluribus, is pretty unique and arguably game changing. At then end of the day, though, the best part of this is not that there are a few interesting topics, it is the fact that all of the topics and players are unique, top shelf and potentially game changing. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially an all star lineup (again) with the likes of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brocade.com&#34;&gt;Brocade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.solarwinds.com/&#34;&gt;Solarwinds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nec.com&#34;&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.velocloud.com/&#34;&gt;VeloCloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudgenix.com/&#34;&gt;Cloudgenix&lt;/a&gt;. This entire line up is right up my alley, as a large number of them are WAN or SDN oriented, which is where I spend the majority of my normal working days. In addition to all of that, I&amp;rsquo;ll finally get to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/networkingnerd&#34;&gt;NetworkingNerd&lt;/a&gt; in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aging hardware, IPv6 and the growing route table</title>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/aging-hardware-ipv6-and-the-growing-route-table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/03/bgp-tools-troubleshooting-and-monitoring-external-routing-in-a-nutshell/&#34; title=&#34;BGP tools; troubleshooting and monitoring external routing in a nutshell&#34;&gt;blathered on about BGP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/tuning-bgp-installed-ipv6-routes/&#34; title=&#34;Tuning BGP installed IPv6 routes&#34;&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;.  Say what you will about the venerable protocol, it runs the interwebs, is reliable, extendable and well documented.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/ &amp;quot;My SDN soapbox (now with IPv6!&#34;&gt;espoused&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/07/joint-techs-summer-2011-ipv6-talks/&#34; title=&#34;Joint Techs Summer 2011 IPv6 talks&#34;&gt;ad nauseam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/03/ipv6-features-matrix-for-network-hardware/&#34; title=&#34;IPv6 Features matrix for Network Hardware&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/and-a-purple-pony/&#34; title=&#34;And a purple pony.&#34;&gt;IPv6&lt;/a&gt;, so none of this [admitted] rant should really be a surprise coming from me. As of 8/12/2014, according to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/#General_Status&#34;&gt;CIRD report&lt;/a&gt; (and many mailing lists), the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default-free_zone&#34;&gt;default free&lt;/a&gt; global ipv4 routing table has reached 512k routes.  This is a milestone from many perspectives, but more importantly, it solidifies the fact that there is a great deal of equipment in critical points in the internet that is out of date and cannot perform as intended in its current configuration or function. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-12-2014-plot.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-12-2014-plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;8-12-2014-plot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is a problem.  This is a problem for old hardware.  This is a problem for anyone that says their border router is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;, and expects to take a default free table.  It&amp;rsquo;s a problem for anyone that wants to be multihomed on sub-par hardware.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that many engineers would be surprised at how common this really is because network hardware is expensive, especially appropriate hardware that runs at site borders and in internet backbones, and by nature network engineer want to &amp;ldquo;make things work&amp;rdquo;.  I assert, however, that this may not be the best idea. The increased size of the default free zone has been forecasted for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;years,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and with the inclusion of the 16k of ipv6 prefixes (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/08/the-sad-state-of-ipv6-and-why-you-need-to-learn-it/&#34; title=&#34;The sad state of IPv6 and why you need to learn it.&#34;&gt;you are running IPv6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?), resources quickly become exhausted on aging hardware.  This causes a cascading problem.  Forget the odd issues seen by not having enough TCAM to house the entire default free ipv4 table.  That problem is a haymaker swing that was telegraphed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ago and should have been coming; that ship has sailed. The bigger problem is that in flurrying around to deal with smaller TCAM sizes on gear that should have been replaced years ago, one course of action is to  repartition the TCAM, stripping away space allocated for IPv6 and allocating it to IPv4 in order to remain &amp;ldquo;default free&amp;rdquo; v4 tables.  I know because I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do this.  And it sucked. Personally, I felt a little like a sell out since I was robbing Peter to pay Paul and keep our &amp;ldquo;beloved&amp;rdquo; IPv4 running at the expense of the protocol we should have been migrated to years before but could not due to fear, uncertainty, doubt and, frankly, sheer laziness on the part of executives, developers, vendors and engineers. Blech.  I don not even like typing that.  We, I promise you,  in come cases are prolonging the deployment of IPv6 in favor of keeping v4 working due to this limitation.  And it stinks.  Like a skunk. Dipped in sewage. Wrapped in garbage.  Blown through an onion. It&amp;rsquo;s a banner day, make no mistake.  512k ipv4 routes in the global default free ipv4 table is a milestone.  However, lets not forget that much of the pain involved in expanding the ability to use more v4 would probably have been better served in expanding ipv6 support.  Be a catalyst for change and start learning and evangelizing IPv6. I often have a thought when discussing the merits of ipv6 with anyone that is arguing as to why they don&amp;rsquo;t want or need to deploy it: Would the internet/their network be a better place if we spent as much time making ipv6 work instead of going well out of our way to work around it? &lt;end rant&gt; =)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crystal Ball: Cisco buying tail-f.  What does it mean?</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/crystal-ball-cisco-buying-tail-f-what-does-it-mean/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 16:24:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/crystal-ball-cisco-buying-tail-f-what-does-it-mean/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tail-f.com/cisco-announces-intent-acquire-tail-f-acquisition-advances-ciscos-cloud-virtualization-portfolio-industry-leading-network-service-orchestration-technology/&#34;&gt;announcement of Cisco Systems intent to purchase tail-f&lt;/a&gt;, proponents of a multi-vendor environment are waiting with baited breath to see how the networking giant will deal with support of competitor hardware and CLIs. Yang is here to stay, there is no doubt about that. As is netconf. Both of these are good things for the industry as a whole, having a standard way to communicate with network hardware [&lt;a href=&#34;http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/opinion/OpenFlow-as-a-network-control-protocol-goes-deeper-than-data-center&#34;&gt;that isn&amp;rsquo;t openflow&lt;/a&gt;] is necessary and immeasurably useful. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the politics, the internal technical bits or even the details of who stays and who goes. Smarter folks than me have &lt;a href=&#34;http://lamejournal.com/2014/06/18/thoughts-cisco-acquiring-tail-f-systems/#more-2999&#34;&gt;already done that&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I want to think about what this means for operators, architects and engineers when looking for a management platform. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2014/02/tail-f-ncs-upsetting-network-management-in-a-good-way/&#34; title=&#34;Tail-F NCS: upsetting network management…in a good way.&#34;&gt;before about how Tail-f was a Rosetta Stone&lt;/a&gt; for networking equipment. With the Cisco acquisition looming, this potentially and very likely changes this and there now exists a gaping hole in this type of management system. So, what does that mean? If I had to guess, I&amp;rsquo;d say that even though Cisco has been a bit more friendly in the opensource world, it makes absolutely no sense for them to support a platform that allows for the use of any network platform. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m being cynical, but I doubt it. What this does is leave the majority of us looking for a cross vendor management solution, where the tail&amp;ndash;f NCS lives, out in the cold. However, there is a silver lining. The cup is half full in the forwarding plane today. My hopes is that the lack of a real commercial product that does what NCS does, and the awareness raised that such a product existed in the first place will kick start the FOSS world into building something. Only since RANCID have I seen a really viable option for cross platform management [and in the case of RANCID management=change and configuration tracking]. This also opens the door for an existing management protocol ::cough:: openflow ::cough:: to emerge as a really viable management and control protocol and mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Net Neutrality changes could force better fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/net-neutrality-changes-could-force-better-fiber-networks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2014 18:40:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/net-neutrality-changes-could-force-better-fiber-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many regular internet users are extremely upset about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/15/fccs-proposed-net-neutrality-rules-pass-3-2-enter-4-month-comment-period/&#34;&gt;recent proposed changes the FCC has opened for comments&lt;/a&gt; about the delivery and provisioning of internet services.  Watch this video if you&amp;rsquo;re unaware of the high emotions it has evoked: While these are proposed rules and are not in any way finalized, there is real concern that they may become law.  Where this is problematic is that it opens up the possibility of some real misuse, abuse or simple misunderstanding of needs and services. Do you want your service to be so heavily monitored that your every source and destination is billed for?  Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s bananas, not to mention confusing and wrought with the possibility of erroneous and/or over billing.  It also required the consumer to be more acutely aware of everything they do, which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, but most won&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t bother to learn, so they become easy targets for predatory companies to charge for services that consumers may not realize they&amp;rsquo;re using. As someone who has run a production ISP on more than one occasion, I can see the huge draw of being able to bill for services.  From a technical perspective, it&amp;rsquo;d be a challenge to manage effectively and fairly and I hate to say it, but from a purely technical standpoint SDN actually makes this kind of granular billing, metering and shaping easier.  From a consumer perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s a nightmare.  Imagine ala cart &amp;ldquo;services&amp;rdquo; like channels on your cable TV.  Hulu? That&amp;rsquo;s $10 more a month.  NetFlix?  That&amp;rsquo;s $15, you get the point.  Fair and open access is the only way to do right be the consumer.  Being an ISP is hard, it&amp;rsquo;s a fine line between quality and profitability and wether folks like it or not, it is a fact that the money comes from oversubscription. What will this possible change in policy mean in the long and short term?  Let me tell you (in a bulleted list!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud data storage services for small businesses become a liability because now they can be double billed for them by IP provider and cloud provider which could _&lt;strong&gt;significantly&lt;/strong&gt; _change how cloud services work and force consumers and businesses to either build their own data centers back up, change their model for data services or forgo cloud services all together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users and businesses may be forced into cloud service provided by their ISP to get around large transit fees and become locked into a proprietary service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of guerilla networks start to pop up again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide spread encrypted overlays and VPNs are used to get around  service fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data caps become normal for every large provider (already happening).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open access municipal and private fiber networks become far more common than they are now.  This is &lt;a href=&#34;http://city-council.cityofdavis.org/Media/Default/Documents/PDF/CityCouncil/CouncilMeetings/Agendas/20140422/04G-RFEI-for-Davis-Broadband.pdf&#34;&gt;already happening&lt;/a&gt; on a smaller scale.  See &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uc2b.net&#34;&gt;UC2B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.utopianet.org/&#34;&gt;UtopiaNet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cirbn.org/&#34;&gt;CIRBN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fiber.google.com/about/&#34;&gt;Google fiber&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settlement free, unmetered peerings and local peering hubs  become far more common between municipal networks, large enterprises and other entities in a given locality and eventually between the peering hubs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horse trading between fiber resources becomes commonplace to reach other resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchasing managed transport services from CLECs to get to exchange points to purchase transit from real providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last mile consumer broadband providers start to feel the pinch and realize they missed the boat.  Remember when cell phone minutes were billed by the minute and everything was an add-on feature?  Me too.  Now it&amp;rsquo;s a capped data plan and everything else is just free. You get the point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the internet providers need to be re-classified as common carriers, and frankly, and the only reason it has not been is that law makers don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; understand it and they&amp;rsquo;re being preyed upon by the large telco and service provider lobbyists.

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I got an email asking me to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;Network Field Day 7&lt;/a&gt;.  I was very happy and humbled to get asked again since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;NFD5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/&#34;&gt;NFD6&lt;/a&gt; for various reasons outside of my control (although I did try to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/network-field-day-5/&#34; title=&#34;Network Field Day 5 – Participate Remotely&#34;&gt;participate with NFD5  remotely&lt;/a&gt;).   If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/&#34;&gt;tech field day&lt;/a&gt; series, you should spend a little time and learn about the value it brings.  There are archived video feeds of &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/timing/past/&#34;&gt;previous conferences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/&#34;&gt;live feed&lt;/a&gt; and social media outlets for current field days. To be included in such an event is an amazing experience in and of itself, but to be included with a technical group like this is pretty humbling.  This NFD includes the likes of &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//bob-mccouch/&#34;&gt;Bob McCouch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/brandon-carroll/&#34;&gt;Brandon Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/chris-marget/&#34;&gt;Chris Marget&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//edward-henry/&#34;&gt;Edward Henry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//ethan-banks/&#34;&gt;Ethan Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/rich-brambley/chris-evans/greg-ferro/&#34;&gt;Greg Ferro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//john-herbert/&#34;&gt;John Herbert&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/josh-obrien/&#34;&gt;Josh O&amp;rsquo;Brien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/matt-oswalt/&#34;&gt;Matt Oswalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate//paul-stewart/&#34;&gt;Paul Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/teren-bryson/&#34;&gt;Teren Bryson&lt;/a&gt;.  All very competent and forward thinking folks in the networking and IT fields.  If this isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to get you interested in the value of this event, let me tell you about the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to be a [good] Network Engineer (and network engineer appreciation day)</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/how-to-be-a-good-network-engineer-and-network-appreciation-engineer-day/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2013 04:02:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/how-to-be-a-good-network-engineer-and-network-appreciation-engineer-day/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My personal background in computing (specifically networking) is atypical.  I have a bachelors in visual arts and only took a handful of computing classes in my relatively long tenure in college.  However, I did learn one valuable lesson that has served me pretty well over the 15 or so years I have been doing networking and I&amp;rsquo;d bet money any good network engineer that has more than 10 years of experience will nod their head at this and agree. A &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; good Network Engineer knows enough about any discipline to successfully function in that role. A network engineer is the &amp;ldquo;grout&amp;rdquo; of nearly every place I have ever worked.  They fill in all the gaps left behind by departures, lack of funding or just general need.  It takes a certain kind of personality to be a good one and when you find a good one, you should keep them, they&amp;rsquo;re hard to come by. As an example, in the course of my career, it has been necessary for me to: 1. Be a UNIX and Linux sysadmin.  This includes such things as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. being a mail server admin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. maintaining web servers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. running monitoring systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. administrating virtual machine hosts (and guests)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e. creating, managing, troubleshooting and upgrading DNS and DHCP servers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Function as a network security policy writer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Act in a desktop support role 4. Modify, debug and create code. 5. Work as a windows server admin 6. Perform as a network security engineer (evaluate, install, debug and maintain firewall, IDS, IPS and VPN devices and platforms) 7. Install, test and debug physical infrastructure such as inside and outside plant fiber and copper. 8. Act as a facility coordinator for power, heat and cooling 9. Test, evaluate and maintain phone systems, PBX, CentrEx and VoIP 10. Aid in the creation of grant proposals 11. Present as a subject matter expert to internal and public audiences 12. Operate as a trusted source of knowledge on nearly everything IT related (and if we don&amp;rsquo;t know, we find out). 13. Oh yeah, keep the network running by having intimate knowledge of networking equipment like routers, switches, customer provisioning gear, DWDM equipment and the interfaces and protocols that make them work. That is just scratching the surface&amp;hellip;..and I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; what I do.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packetpushers.net&#34;&gt;packet pushers&lt;/a&gt; said it well.  &amp;ldquo;Too much networking would never be enough&amp;rdquo;. For all of the up and coming network engineers [and the seasoned veterans, too], I offer this bit of unsolicited advice: Don&amp;rsquo;t be a Luddite. Love what you do.  In IT the only constant is change.  Embrace it.  Learn new technology.  Think outside of the box and step outside of your comfort zone.  Never be comfortable with &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.  Strive to know more about whatever it is you are working on.  Be positive.  Help others learn.  Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about credit and recognition and just do great work, if you do the rest will work itself out. This post is my ode to the network engineer.  On Network Engineer appreciation day (which should be a thing.  if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, I decree it is every November 12th), think of these things and remember that even if no one remembers network engineer appreciation day, we&amp;rsquo;ll still keep the packets moving and fill in the rest of the gaps too. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being single vendor does your brain a disservice.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/being-single-vendor-does-your-brain-a-disservice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2013 15:30:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/being-single-vendor-does-your-brain-a-disservice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear, when I say &amp;ldquo;single vendor&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m talking about being &amp;ldquo;single vendor&amp;rdquo; in what you work on, not necessarily what you install (although one basically forces the other) and what I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; mean is multilingual.  I&amp;rsquo;ll explain after a brief history of why I am the way I am. I&amp;rsquo;m idealistic but I&amp;rsquo;m also realistic.  I generally propose solutions that I think are best even if it is non-standard or out of current comfort level along with an alternative or two.  I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to work in a single vendor shop.  As an art student in the 1990s I had been gaming over a 10Base-2 network that my roommate and I had built and realized that building that network was more fun than playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%28video_game%29&#34;&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; over IPX.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Doom_cover_art.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Doom_cover_art.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Doom_cover_art&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I wanted to get into networking so badly that I worked on almost anything that presented itself.  In the early days I would take on all of the projects that no one wanted, often on things I had never seen before, learning them on the fly just so I could get my hands on more things to learn from.  This was pretty easy to get away with in the 1990s since networking wasn&amp;rsquo;t considered as much of a utility and folks willing to work on these kinds of things were few and far between.  It gave me an environment very conducive to learning every aspect of a protocol or platform.  This actually made me more versatile and essentially forced me to learn standards based networking.  It removed the reliance on proprietary technologies and forced me to really know the protocols or at the very least know where to find the info.  It taught me early on that memorizing was not the best way for me and that I had to know were to look instead of just knowing.   Doing work like this taught me how to study better than college had. I&amp;rsquo;ve made my insignificant mark in the world of networking by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickburaglio.com/2013/08/24/boba-fett-1981/&#34;&gt;being able to adapt&lt;/a&gt; to whatever I had to work on, admittedly sometimes begrudgingly.   Just like almost everyone else, my base was in Cisco IOS but I always had a Cisco &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a something else to work on or install.  Be that an Ascend, Netopia, OpenRoute, Livingston/Lucent, Xylan, Juniper, Redback, Force10, Extreme, Fujitsu, Foundry, Nortel&amp;hellip;..this list can go on and on.  I found that being able to adapt and work on whatever was there opened my mind to different and often more simple and supportable ways of doing things and freed me from the tunnel vision that can sometimes accompany the marketing speak. In the networking world, Cisco has the lions share of the market, no question.  Cisco has been a company of acquisitions and one could probably successfully argue that working on CatOS, IOS, NXOS and IOS-XR is technically &amp;ldquo;multi-vendor&amp;rdquo; by the spirit of the law.  That&amp;rsquo;s actually a valid point, however, vendors tend to build and market proprietary solutions based around their products.  They want you to buy their widget, their cog, their $whatever, because they all work together. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grumpy-old-man.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grumpy-old-man.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grumpy old man&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is close to true, I tire of the old adage &amp;ldquo;no one ever got fired for buying cisco&amp;rdquo;. Now, before you go and get your grumpy old man pants on and start flashing your Cisco tattoo, let me better explain my logic. Network operating systems are not unlike programming languages. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone will argue against that too passionately.  Programming languages are generally very different in structure from language to language and are processed in the brain much like a spoken or written language.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/&#34;&gt;Studies have shown that being multilingual actually makes the brain more nimble, quicker, better able to deal with ambiguities, resolve conflicts and even resist Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia longer&lt;/a&gt;. Being able to context switch keeps your mind sharp. In addition, utilizing hardware and software from different vendors forces standards based networking and reduces what I consider a crutch of relying on proprietary protocols that stifle the ability to migrate to different vendors. I have run into the excuse of &amp;ldquo;we already have institutional knowledge of x&amp;rdquo; all throughout my career, and while I certainly understand the viewpoint, I find this to be a surmountable excuse.  If there exists a product or solution that is better suited for the task at hand, brand should be irrelevant.  There are enough valid, cost effective and [arguably] technically superior options out there that brand loyalty should take a far, far back seat.  Learning is our job and we need to be willing and able to adapt to thrive.  I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that comfort level and familiarity should not be a factor, not at all.  Supportability is paramount.  However, that should be &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; factor, not the &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; factor. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to take risks.  Lab up new things.  You will truly never know if something is better, worse or a wash unless you give it a chance.  You may just learn something by accident. The point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make is that we do ourselves and potentially the consumers of the service we build a disservice when we blindly write off options because of our own personal comfort level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The sad state of IPv6 and why you need to learn it.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-sad-state-of-ipv6-and-why-you-need-to-learn-it/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 11:18:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/the-sad-state-of-ipv6-and-why-you-need-to-learn-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been learning and using IPv6 for a quite a while, even before I worked in research and education, back in the ISP days.  I thought I should learn it because, frankly, I figured we&amp;rsquo;d all be converted to it by now, already whole hog using it like it was the layer 3 addressing mechanism that it is.  Flashback: My first IPv6 access was via a tunnel to HE a long, long time ago and before that I was reading what I could about it.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been evangelizing IPv6 for about that long, too.  I&amp;rsquo;ve taught IPv6 networking workshops on many occasions showing eager network engineers, security engineers, sysadmins, incident responders and even the occasional CIO how to understand, interpret and plumb v6. Now, I love OpenFlow and SDN as much as the next network geek, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s about as disruptive and game changing as the next guy.  However, IPv6 is next.  There.  I said it.  We need it.  Hey, OpenFlow 1.3 supports it so there is your tie in.  We&amp;rsquo;re out of v4 for the most part and, lets be honest, NAT is a freaking abomination. It&amp;rsquo;s not a solution to anything other than over complicating a transit path with translational mappings. I recently received an email from a buddy from my first days in tech about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enhancedip.org/home&#34;&gt;a project that some colleagues of his had been working on&lt;/a&gt; and while at a base technical level it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting concept, this project infuriated me.  This is the problem with the industry, especially in North America. The right thing, in my opinion, is to put effort like this aside and concentrate on IPv6 development and deployment. Projects like this, while good intentioned and technically innovative, delay he inevitable and give lazy, &amp;ldquo;luddist&amp;rdquo; engineers and developers a way to keep ipv4 even longer. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/alarm_clock.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/alarm_clock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alarm_clock&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have mostly just kept this to myself publicly.  Sure, I blather on about it the office and preach about IPv6 over beers with networking professionals, but mostly I just suffer and bite my tongue when I hear some enterprise architect talk about firewalls, NAT, IPv4 only security appliances and how &amp;ldquo;they don&amp;rsquo;t need IPv6&amp;rdquo; or how &amp;ldquo;the enterprise isn&amp;rsquo;t ready&amp;rdquo; [for IPv6]. Wake up call, you&amp;rsquo;re late. &lt;strong&gt;IPv6 is here&lt;/strong&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;been&lt;/strong&gt; here.  It&amp;rsquo;s all over in Asia and other parts of the world.  It&amp;rsquo;s supported by default by your consumer service provider.  Guess what?  It&amp;rsquo;s too bad that your lazy developers didn&amp;rsquo;t code your apps for it. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad that your specialized app only supports IPv4 and probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t even understand DNS.  You&amp;rsquo;ll eventually have to deal with IPv6.  In actuality, you&amp;rsquo;re likely already using it and have no idea it is happening.  If someone finally tore that legacy XP machine from your change-despising hands you&amp;rsquo;re probably tunneling your traffic.  Unless you explicitly disable IPv6 on a modern operating system, you&amp;rsquo;re using it.  It may be just locally on your segment, but it&amp;rsquo;s on.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/borg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/borg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;borg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Get on board.  Resistance is futile.  There are great resources for learning IPv6.  Your desktop and server OS have probably supported it for years.  Your routers likely support routing it.  The last parts are going to be the security devices, policy and the legacy apps.  If you&amp;rsquo;re a networking guy, go do the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipv6.he.net/certification/&#34;&gt;HE tunnelbroker certification process. &lt;/a&gt; They have a very good fundamentals tutorial and it covers everything you need to know to get started.  You can also get a cool shirt and some code to shove into your website.  Mine looks like this:// &amp;lt;![CDATA[ var user = &amp;ldquo;buraglio&amp;rdquo;; display_swf(user); // ]]&amp;gt;   Take the plunge, get some IPv6 going in your enterprise, home network, lab, whatever.  Learn and educate.  It will only improve your value and you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to learn it later anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I want to love cumulus networks.....</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/i-want-to-love-cumulus-networks/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 22:08:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/i-want-to-love-cumulus-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to preface this by saying that I have not seen or worked on the cumulus networks system yet. This is a stream of consciousness post on my thoughts and opinions based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve read publicly.&lt;/em&gt; Recently a &lt;a href=&#34;http://cumulusnetworks.com/&#34;&gt;new network player&lt;/a&gt; has emerged on the scene with a very simple, straightforward idea. Take linux and put it on a switch. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly new (see Juniper and FreeBSD, Arista with Linux, Force10 with NetBSD or the plethora of other vendors using an opensource OS as the underpinnings of their NOS), the angle that cumulus networks is taking is a bit more&amp;hellip;.raw. Take a standard Cisco or Juniper box. The engineers that work on these devices know a pseudo-programming language. They program the routers using that language and syntax. They&amp;rsquo;re familiar with it and it is well documented. Heck, aside from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juniper.net/us/en/community/junos/training-certification/day-one/fundamentals-series/cli/&#34;&gt;JunOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enterasys.com/&#34;&gt;Enterasys&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://infoproducts.alcatel-lucent.com/html/0_add-h-f/93-0070-10-01/7750_SR_OS_System_Basics_Guide/CLI%20Usage.html&#34;&gt;Alcatel-Lucent,&lt;/a&gt; 90% of the NOS you see on equipment is arguably derivative of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s venerable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/fundamentals/configuration/guide/cf_cli-basics.html&#34;&gt;IOS&lt;/a&gt;. Automation is [unfortunately] not nearly as common as it could be on network gear. Sure, there are a handful of opensource tools, overpriced, bloated and [arguably] poorly functioning tools available to &amp;ldquo;automate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; equipment, but none are that great, especially if you have a large, diverse environment. Enter the sysadmin. Sysadmins have been automating tasks for as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been around. &lt;a href=&#34;http://cfengine.com/&#34;&gt;cfengine&lt;/a&gt;, home grown tools and now &lt;a href=&#34;https://puppetlabs.com/&#34;&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt; and the like are marvelous tools that are a makeshift &amp;ldquo;controller&amp;rdquo; for managing distributed systems. Big Iron cluster admins have had tools like this forever as well. How often are these people the same? In a large environment where there is a need for automation I will wager that the answer to that question is &amp;ldquo;not very often&amp;rdquo;. This is my concern with cumulus networks. Make no mistake, I love the simplicity and idea behind it. I think that it&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully simple and innovative. It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;duh&amp;rdquo; of networking OS choices, but it introduces a lot of issues, many of which aren&amp;rsquo;t really pleasant to solve (and only a handful are actually technical). You&amp;rsquo;ve got the fractured nature of IT in large environments. Server guys aren&amp;rsquo;t often the same as networks guys. Often they are in totally different silos. This is problematic due to territoriality not to mention subject matter expertise. Am I as a network engineer of 15+ years comfortable running *IX systems? Sure. Is everyone? Likely not and even less likely on a large scale like this. Automation is key, but even running puppet systems isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a network engineers core competency. I think that building those systems will be either cost prohibitive (either time or salary) or will just be a non-started because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too different&amp;rdquo;. Let me reiterate that I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very cool idea and know that it&amp;rsquo;d probably take a week or so to make work for any decent sysadmin or system savvy network engineer, but the large swath is going to recoil. The lack of a single configuration file is also off putting to many network engineers. Management systems may be able to handle some of these functions, but nothing is easier than nearly zero touch deployment and a single config file is a poor-mans, widely accepted method. They have a quagga instance their version which provides a &amp;ldquo;non-model CLI&amp;rdquo;, and if the quagga is anything like what I&amp;rsquo;ve used it can sorta be used to manage the network, but is a poor overlay to the system tools that adds very basic routing protocols. It&amp;rsquo;s encouraging, but feels like a bolt on at face value. Then there is the issue of the raw OS. It&amp;rsquo;s just Linux. This statement alone opens up a new vector. Does one need to now worry about having compromised switches? Can my switch be turned into a bit cannon or a warez distribution site? A Tor relay? Hardening a switch or router has always been important, but this feels different to me and how many times has a RE protect ACL or loopback filter been mistakenly forgotten? What happens when there is a kernel exploit? Sure, puppet and cfengine can help with that, but these are also mechanisms and processes that need to be taken into account as far as resources on the switches. How will these extra processes affect the transit traffic? What happens when Linux decides it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough resources and starts killing off processes? Now, I think there are good precurser to this model that have been around for quite some time. I&amp;rsquo;d really love to see something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pfsense.org&#34;&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microtic.com&#34;&gt;RouterOS&lt;/a&gt; on a merchant silicon Layer3 switch. The foundations are already there, they are seasoned, well documented and feature rich platforms. RouterOS even has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pfsense_logo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pfsense_logo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pfsense_logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Vrz21.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Vrz21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vrz21&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OpenFlow support now and I&amp;rsquo;d bet money pfSense is looking at integrating SDN of some sort. Both have central management platforms and are Linux or BSD based, so they are very extensible and at their foundation they are Open Source. Both should be portable and most importantly they are more of a intermediate step into a hybrid networking OS. I know some of this may sound negative, but these are all things that need to be addressed and answered as we move more into the new wave of networking. I am confident that cumulus networks is onto something great with their model. It it too bold? Too soon? I wish I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A missing link in small MPLS, 10G devices.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-missing-link/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 04:43:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-missing-link/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the fact that there seems to be a lack of options in a very specific product level.  Lets say you have a network that looks like this:   &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/10G-Bldg1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/10G-Bldg1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;10G-Bldg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Right Away you&amp;rsquo;re limited since you need MPLS and more than 2 10G interfaces. Even more so if you require full support for IPv6 and ISIS. If budget is of any concern, you&amp;rsquo;re in real trouble. For many, Cisco pricing and smartnet is potentially going to exclude anything reasonable from them.  There are a substantial amount of non-enterprise folks out there that can&amp;rsquo;t afford the significant Cisco price tag but need the features.  I am here to say, this is a problem.  The attitude of &amp;ldquo;if you want the best you have to pay for it&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply.  There is a real need for viable alternatives, not just because we need them, but because competition is a good thing for everyone. Juniper has the MX80, but it has a carrier grade price tag as well.  Juniper has limited MPLS support on the EX series, but the EX4200, which is arguably the most tried and true, has only 2 ports of 10G and, as mentioned, limited MPLS support.  The EX4500 is a tad better with its huge amount of 10G ports, but it has the same limited MPLS support and a crippled ARP and FIB table.  The 4550 with it&amp;rsquo;s single PFE sounds exciting but it has even less. Then you have the Brocade CES/R.  It is close.  The newer version has  4 x 10G ports, MPLS support (with a license), more appropriately priced support and, as a value add, very good OpenFlow support.  It is still limited as far as 10G scalability, so adding more access switches could be problematic. HP has some great products in the Procurve series.  They&amp;rsquo;re inexpensive, rock solid and packed with features. Unfortunately, the ones that meet the port density are fairly good sized chassis and none of them have MPLS.  Now, they do have an intriguing line up in the H3C series.  I believe there may be an option there, however, I have no idea on pricing and have yet to see one actually do MPLS (although they claim support).  I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic. Then you have Alcatel Lucent.   They do MPLS, they&amp;rsquo;re carrier devices.  They offer a 1U ( (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/products/7210-service-access-switch&#34;&gt;7210 Service Access Switch&lt;/a&gt;) device but I have no idea on cost and I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for 10G port density.  I suspect it is very reasonable.  Their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/12/alcatel-lucent-rancid-scripts/&#34; title=&#34;Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts&#34;&gt;CLI is a bit different&lt;/a&gt; but they&amp;rsquo;re very robust devices.  I&amp;rsquo;ve not used any but the 7750, so I cant comment as to how the smaller ones look.  It&amp;rsquo;s a possibility if it has the 10G ports. Arista is very close but they fall short on the MPLS support.   The primary take away from this commentary is that there are not a lot of options that meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2U&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;gt; 4 10G ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual power supplies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;gt; 16,000/4,000 IPv4/IPv6 routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPv6 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40G uplink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenFlow support or roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonably priced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep coming back to the old adage of &amp;ldquo;Cheap, Fast, Reliable.  Pick Two&amp;rdquo; and it drives me crazy.  We should have more options but I don&amp;rsquo;t think we do.  I would absolutely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; to be wrong, but every time I look at this I feel like I am picking out a cell phone plan.  The affordable ones are never quite enough and the plan above is overkill and too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My SDN soapbox (now with IPv6!)</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2013 21:45:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/my-sdn-soapbox-now-with-ipv6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week there was a lot of buzz about SDN (as usual). There was a&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightreading.com/blog/software-defined-networking/sdns-killer-app-more-network-control/240151376&#34;&gt; lightreading thread that I commented on&lt;/a&gt; and a fantastic read by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/networkstatic&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/be-the-steamroller-not-the-road/&#34;&gt;being the steamroller and not the road&lt;/a&gt; that got me thinking about OpenFlow and SDN in a way I had not before. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fearofchange.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fearofchange.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fearofchange&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;soapbox&gt; All that is old is new again. I remember when internal networks were small and routing protocols were taboo in many internal environments. RIP (AKA routing by rumor) was about as innovative as we got, OSPF was &amp;ldquo;too complex&amp;rdquo; and was &amp;ldquo;software changing the network topology&amp;rdquo;, according to some folks I worked with in what seems like a lifetime ago. Clearly they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the entire picture and were clouded by FUD. Now using a link state protocol is a standard and one would probably not consider building a complex, production layer 3 network without an IGP like ISIS or OSPFv[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (or even EIGRP&amp;hellip;I guess). This is simple evolution and progression. The more folks try to resist, the further behind they&amp;rsquo;ll be left. SDN and OpenFlow are not unlike IPv6 in many ways when viewed from a technology implementation perspective, and in fact, we can probably learn from the resistance to IPv6 to help us with the acceptance of SDN and OpenFlow. V6 has been coming for years. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; here. Backbones have been running it for a very long time and we actually &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; it on the client side to account for the huge number of hosts now connecting to the public Internet. Many entities, especially very risk averse enterprises, are struggling to resist it (IPv6) and hold onto NAT and IPv4 as long as possible.  While this will almost certainly buy them a handful of years, it&amp;rsquo;s futile.  Translation and transition tech geared toward the folks that refuse to adapt will allow them to grasp onto legacy methodologies for a bit longer, but as the Borg say, &amp;ldquo;resistance is futile&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Borg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Borg-300x274.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Borg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These same things are all going to happen with SDN. What we say is &amp;ldquo;OpenFlow is simply an open protocol for creating flow based forwarding.  It allows for the inclusion of other factors such as Layer4 to make those decisions more tunable and granular.&amp;rdquo; What skeptics hear is &amp;ldquo;There is a hole in the boat, we&amp;rsquo;re all going to die&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Network Engineers are all going to be out of a job!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;your job is going to be replaced by software&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;software and applications will make the way we think about and do everything obsolete&amp;rdquo;, all of which translate to &amp;ldquo;dramatic and drastic change&amp;rdquo;. Most of this is just sensationalism and FUD. In my opinion, though, it is all based in truth .  It may be &amp;ldquo;drastic&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s not dramatic.  It&amp;rsquo;s natural evolution.  It will happen slowly.  We will have to change they way we do things. The proven fact we as networking and security professionals need to remember is that change going to happen with or without SDN, it&amp;rsquo;s the nature of an innovative field like technology to change.  None of us would be doing what we do without being inquisitive enough to figure out problems, challenge norms and shift thinking. SDN, just like IPv6, is happening.  Personally I&amp;rsquo;d rather be knowledgeable about as opposed to in the dark and scrambling to learn about them at the 11th hour. &lt;/soapbox&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Network Field Day 5 - Participate Remotely</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-5/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 14:59:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/network-field-day-5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;Networking Field Day&lt;/a&gt; was something that I&amp;rsquo;d heard of but wasn&amp;rsquo;t really aware of what is really was.  I occasionally looked at Twitter and saw the hash tags but did not know much about how it was set up or what it was about.  In fact, I actually thought it was supposed to be like the HAM radio field day stuff where you go out and build out an emergency network on the fly.  OK, I should have done more homework, admittedly. Fast forward 6 months. I&amp;rsquo;m working more and more with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkstatic.com&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; on day job stuff and he&amp;rsquo;s encouraging me to brush the dust off of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net&#34;&gt;old blog&lt;/a&gt; (which became this site). I&amp;rsquo;m working more on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/02/building-a-floodlight-openflow-controller-on-centos-6/&#34; title=&#34;Building a Floodlight OpenFlow controller on CentOS 6&#34;&gt;OpenFlow&lt;/a&gt;,  virtualization stuff like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/centos-kvm-install-quick-start-to-a-vm/&#34; title=&#34;CentOS KVM Install – Quick Start to a VM&#34;&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/01/headless-virtualbox-host-on-centos/&#34; title=&#34;Headless VirtualBox host on CentOS&#34;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; and bringing up 100G WAN links.  I even had the extremely cool opportunity to do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetpushers.net/show-131-golf-cart-in-my-fibre-tunnel/&#34;&gt;Packet Pushers Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these things are a direct result of becoming more engaged in the larger community, a networking community I had pretty much carved myself out of back in 2002 when I left the service provider world for R&amp;amp;E.  This self isolation was a bit of an oversight on my part. What I did not realize was that, as someone in R&amp;amp;E, I had a unique perspective on some of the industry products and direction and was often seeing things a lot sooner than the general enterprise world. As I got more and more engaged I realized that there were a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of great folks out there that like to collaborate, share and write about their professional experiences in our field of choice.  These same people were doing innovative and interesting things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;NFD&lt;/a&gt; was one of those things.  So, I started to write down more of the things I was thinking and doing.  I figured that at least someone would find them useful or interesting or at least fodder for solving insomnia.  When I was asked to participate and come out to NFD5, I was both ecstatic and humbled at the same time.  This was the place where the networking industry thought leaders go to convene and discuss directionality as well as current networking technologies. Just to relay the scale and scope of the folks involved, here is the list of delegates for NFD5:  &lt;/p&gt;

The list of vendor participants is also deep.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juniper.net&#34;&gt;Juniper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruckuswireless.com&#34;&gt;Ruckus Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;www.plexxi.com/&#34;&gt;Plexxi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;www.brocade.com/&#34;&gt;Brocade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.solarwinds.com&#34;&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; are all on the docket. Unfortunately for me, I was not able to attend due to work scheduling and coordination of family stuff, something I truly lament.  To think that I was even considered to be on that list is truly humbling and something I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. Not being able to attend, I wanted to participate as much as I could, so I started looking around and talking to folks and found the link to the live feed as well as the Twitter hashtag. It seems like a good idea to put this out there to as many folks as possible to not only bring attention to the fact that this is happening, but that you can participate from wherever you are.  I would encourage anyone who reads this and is interested in Networking as a profession, or is already in our industry, to pay attention to the Tech Field Day events.  Watch the live stream.  Ask questions and make comments on Twitter via the hashtag &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFD5&#34;&gt;#NFD5&lt;/a&gt;.  Get involved. During the event you should be able to do a live stream from right inside this post or from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/&#34;&gt;NFD5 page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alternate model for Service Provider networks; or how to keep net neutrality intact</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/alternate-model-for-sp-networks/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 05:34:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/alternate-model-for-sp-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of buzz about the service provider model, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality&#34;&gt;net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; and tiered access for consumers in the past few years.  Just this week &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/19/3894182/french-isp-orange-says-google-pays-to-send-traffic&#34;&gt;Google has been accused of paying Orange&lt;/a&gt; (more likely Orange is forcing google) for handling its traffic.  This is a VERY slippery slope that teeters on the edge of what we all want to avoid as consumers or content creators. This recent story has sparked something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a very long time. Rewind to 1999. I worked for a small, regional broadband provider what seems like a lifetime ago, back when broadband was new and shiny and not terribly common.  We provided ATM based DSL, T1, ISDN and on some occasions dry copper gorilla net access to southern Chicago communities, Champaign-Urbana, IL, Danville, IL, Kankakee, IL,  a bit of west Indiana and a handful of small communities in between.  It was a proving ground for a young, motivated networking guy.  I was the senior network engineer, technical lead and for a while had a handful of direct report employees and students. This was where I really cut my teeth with routing, switching, content delivery and service levels. I ended up leaving there and moving on to work on a lot of HPC work and bleeding edge WAN stuff (think n x 10Gbps across the country in 2003).  However, one thing I took away from that ISP job was something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a new idea as much as just a uniquely positioned service and a good idea.  There was this local POP connection run by the university that allowed for exchange of  routes between any network that could pay the local loop charge.  It was a way to get cheap, fast access to anything local.  Unmetered, unfiltered.  Exchange any routes you want (that you own), take whatever routes you need. This was a clever model because down where we are located, 2.5 hours south of Chicago, transit bandwidth wasn&amp;rsquo;t (and isn&amp;rsquo;t) cheap.  Every local provider connected as did the community hospital, the university and a handful of others.  We took FULL advantage of fast connectivity between each other and all saved on transit bandwidth.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_research_and_education_network&#34;&gt;This kind of thing has been in place in the R&amp;amp;E&lt;/a&gt; community for far longer than I&amp;rsquo;ve been around. Fast forward 11 years. I&amp;rsquo;m still a huge fan of bi-lateral BGP peerings.  I want as many as I can get.  As a service provider I want a default free network with a lot of peers in many geographically diverse locations. I propose a [not-so]new model for service providers.  Create peering points, meet me routers.  Allow any network to connect for a port fee and exchange local routes.  Make these local routes free, unlimited and unfiltered (do your proper capacity planning, of course).  Opening up exchanges promotes better, diverse paths to resources and allows for a better overall user experience. Data is where the telecom companies make their money nowadays.  Net Neutrality is constantly in the news and in danger of being compromised.  Tiered services are everywhere.  I understand the need to meter service.  I did the ISP thing, I know that 5% of the users use 80% of the bandwidth.  That&amp;rsquo;s not new either.  I challenge larger service providers to think about it in a new way, though.  We&amp;rsquo;re making it work.  It&amp;rsquo;s a smaller scale, but it works.  I think it can scale if architected correctly.  It may have more operational overhead, but I suspect it can also command a bit more in price.  It could also allow for the non-asterisked use of the word &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo;, so marketing guys will love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it more engineering? Sure.  Is it harder to manage? Maybe, but likely not harder than architecting around content providers that don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay.  It is a better idea and promoting better service for both content providers and consumers of their service than making content providers pay for transit?  Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re doing this on &lt;a href=&#34;http://uc2b.net&#34;&gt;UC2B&lt;/a&gt;. It played a part in winning us the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natoa.org/2012/09/natoa-announces-recipients-of-4.html&#34;&gt;Community Broadband Project of the Year award from the NATOA&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SDN Across the WAN, part deux.  Primitives.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-the-wan-part-deux-primitives/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2013 03:18:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-the-wan-part-deux-primitives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34; title=&#34;SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look&#34;&gt;lamenting about the SDN WAN&lt;/a&gt; options for a while now.  Having SDN/OpenFlow in a data center or campus is relatively well documented and already widely deployed.  Google has been doing SDN across their private WAN in production.  These pieces are easy.  What isn&amp;rsquo;t easy is the ability to plumb SDN across many domains that are under disparate control.   This part is hard. What is lacking is a fundamental framework, or set of primitives to build from.  As an example, how does one build a SDN path across this:   &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-Reference-Architecture-Sanitized.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;SDN Reference Architecture -Sanitized&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First I think we need to define what we want out of the SDN path.  A reserved bandwidth allocation?  A Layer2 path?  Flow instantiation across the entire path?  The first two have a least common denominator.  The third is hard, especially if the path transits a segment with no SDN capability. This piece is making my brain hurt.  There seems to be a lot of early work on this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.internet2.edu/speakers/speakers.php?go=people&amp;amp;id=2865&#34;&gt;Inder Monga&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net&#34;&gt;ESnet&lt;/a&gt; has been working at making this happen, and I think he&amp;rsquo;s the closest from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my searching and researching.   I want to know how to do this across &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; networks.   I want to see the future of carrier WAN connectivity, to taste the unicorn milk. The methodology so far has been to break this down into small black boxes.  After doing that, I realized that there is going to have to be a common protocol.  The least common denominator to all of this is the SDN.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t much matter what that SDN is as long as there is a central controller.  It can be OpenFlow, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net/services/virtual-circuits-oscars/&#34;&gt;OSCARS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Multi-Protocol_Label_Switching&#34;&gt;GMPLS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ext.delaat.net/olex/index.html&#34;&gt;Open LightPath Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, whatever.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.  They all need a controller.  Within those controllers there needs to be &amp;ldquo;an energy field created by all SDN. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together&amp;rdquo;.  Yes, I like Star Wars. So, how would one do this?  It would be ideal, to me at least, if there was a standard set of protocols that all of these controllers could speak.  This standard communication could be as simple as how a BGP peering functions.  Site A has a controller, it &amp;ldquo;peers&amp;rdquo; with it&amp;rsquo;s upstream and announces its capabilities. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SDN-peering.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;SDN peering&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All of these peers exchange capability information and pass it on with a standardized set of language and a location identifier (think ASN and route announcements).  To me this appears to be the lowest hanging fruit. I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer but there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be to be any reason that this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be built into any controller, commercial or opensource. That way, regardless of vendor, SDN implementation or capabilities everyone can create a SDN path based on the available implementations upstream. Of course, there would need to be a &amp;ldquo;multihop&amp;rdquo; option for those that have to upstream SDN paths. In this case something like a GRE tunnel could be the lowest common denominator. This would have to transcend OpenFlow and be a true &amp;ldquo;SDN&amp;rdquo; at the fundamental level to actually work, but it needs to take into account managing the flow table of networks outside of a given administrative domain. As a starting point, here is the framework I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable transport: TCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication method: MD5 Capabilities exchanged:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of SDN (MPLS, VLAN, DWDM Waves, OpenFlow Version, Flow manipulation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandwidth per circuit (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of circuit or flow (path TTL, permanent?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path validation (to ensure end to end connectivity over negotiated methodology)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking a lot with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkstatic.net/&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; about this.  I know folks are thinking about it.  Bill Owens &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/#comment-47&#34;&gt;had some great comments&lt;/a&gt; to my last post regarding this and I think he&amp;rsquo;s totally spot on.  However, I want to hit 88mph in my Delorean and see the future.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s a ways way off but someone needs to come up with this framework.  SDN is so disjointed that it needs a one ring.  Controlling the forwarding plane of someone else network is scary and needs to have a leash on it.  Building this standard protocol could be it.  Unfortunately, I am no developer but I do know a little bit about running a decent sized network.  There will need to be safeguards, policy and knobs to tweak.  I keep coming back to BGP.  It&amp;rsquo;s not as much of a routing protocol as it is a policy framework disguised as a routing protocol.  There needs to be something similar with SDN. I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue to think through this publicly and I welcome constructive input.     &lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-alto-protocol/&#34;&gt;ALTO&lt;/a&gt; is pretty close.  There has been a lot of work going on but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s all the way to where we need it to be.  Some interesting proof of concept and detail stuff can be read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ewsdn.eu/presentations/ALTOwrtSDN.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://opennetsummit.org/talks/ward-wed.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to install and use the Airport utility under Mountain Lion</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/how-to-install-and-use-the-airport-utility-under-mountain-lion/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 09:58:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/how-to-install-and-use-the-airport-utility-under-mountain-lion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of Apple wireless gear  at my house.  It&amp;rsquo;s inexpensive, feature rich and easy to maintain.  However, with the update to mountain lion a while ago, the ability to install  the older Airport Utility stopped.  This is annoying since I have what apple now considers &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; features like IPv6 at my home and essentially all my gear here is a lab (except for the plex server =) I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cacti.net&#34;&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; lately, and I wanted to test out the syslog plugin&amp;hellip;.ok, easy.  It&amp;rsquo;s all set up.  Then I got to thinking &amp;ldquo;why not just let this run and syslog all my gear like the good &amp;lsquo;ol days?&amp;rdquo;  Nerdy?  Yes, but hey, I collect flow data at home and have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/homenet/&#34;&gt;weathermap&lt;/a&gt; of my home network.  It keeps me eating my own dog food with the netflow exporter plugin on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pfsense.org&#34;&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s fun. Uh, oh.  No ability to set syslog receiver on the airport gear anymore.  Not cool.  [Guess what, no way to change IPv6 settings anymore either] No way to do a standard install of the old utility. Lame, Apple, Lame.  After poking around a bit I found a pretty easy way to do it as long as you&amp;rsquo;re not afraid of the command line. Since at least a few other folks will want to do this, here it is: &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1536&#34;&gt;Download the App&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. Mount the Downloaded disk. Open Terminal. Type:&lt;code&gt;
pkgutil --expand /Volumes/AirPortUtility/AirPortUtility56.pkg
cd ~/Desktop/AirPortTemp~/Desktop/AirPortTemp/AirPortUtility56Lion.pkg/
open Payload
cd &amp;quot;Payload 2 2/Applications/Utilities/&amp;quot;
open .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-11.32.08-PM.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-11.32.08-PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 11.32.08 PM&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Done.  That should open a finder window with the App in it.  You can copy it to you /Applications/Utilities folder and use it alongside the newer one.  You&amp;rsquo;ll need to authenticate to copy into the /Applications/Utilities directory. Edits made and Poof!  Now I can see my syslogs from within cacti.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where will Cisco go from here?</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/where-will-cisco-go-from-here/</link>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/where-will-cisco-go-from-here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fosketts.net/about/stephen-foskett/&#34;&gt;Stephen Foskett&lt;/a&gt;s post &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fosketts.net/2013/01/02/cisco-recover-consumer-strategy-blunder/&#34;&gt;How Will Cisco Recover From The Consumer Strategy Blunder?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, it got me thinking.  It&amp;rsquo;s a very different world than when Cisco got started all those years ago.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have any brand loyalty to Cisco, I learned on cisco gear 14-15 years ago for the most part, but I try to keep the mentality of &amp;ldquo;the right tool for the job&amp;rdquo;, which means constantly surveying th emarket for new and interesting ways to do things.  In doing this, it&amp;rsquo;s really opened my eyes over the last 10 years.  There are so many more ways to do what needs to be done in networking day to day that are cheaper, supportable and in some cases easier, than going with the big Cisco.  that&amp;rsquo;s not saying that their gear isn&amp;rsquo;t fantastic.  I do love it, it works well for the most part and is very sell supported and documented.   &lt;img src=&#34;http://lcolumbus.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ciscosystems.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt; I mostly agree with his sentiments.  I think Cisco needs to re-evaluate all of their offerings.  Re-focusing on what worked before is one strategy, but it may not be the best one. They&amp;rsquo;ve gone into the data center in the last 10 years with new products, their aquisition of topspin gave them IB when it was hot.  I&amp;rsquo;ve personally not seen much of anything from them with Infiniband in recent memory and I believe they killed off their IB switches. They&amp;rsquo;ve done deals and made purpose built servers in the past (think call manager and compaq) that were less than stellar.  Storage is key, but he&amp;rsquo;s right, they&amp;rsquo;d have to buy some key or upstart gold mine players since it&amp;rsquo;s a total shift in technology.  Convergence is a nice idea.  I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen it really done well but I&amp;rsquo;d love to, so if they can pull it off that&amp;rsquo;d be a great feather in their cap.  Brocade is very well positioned to master convergence and steal that away. The Nexus is a fine box, but it&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of competition from the likes of Brocade, Arista, Extreme and even Juniper for the DC. In the service provider space they&amp;rsquo;ve been getting inched out by Juniper for a very long time and technically speaking Alcatel Lucent has a very good platform in that area as well. Their large / carrier security platforms have a lot of arguably better offerings from the likes of Juniper, Fortinet and Palo Alto. Their core routers have been getting inched out by Brocade, Extreme, Juniper and even Alcatel Lucent. And what about price? Is their venerable IOS enough to warrant the double and triple price tags and high cost of maintenance? In my small corner of the world it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Operationally it&amp;rsquo;s no harder or more cost for us to run a box that is IOS-like, or JunOS. From my admittedly skewed perspective their bread and butter is in the MPLS PE devices, smaller security appliances and possibly the ASR series. &amp;hellip;unless they can pull a Hail Mary SDN solution and corner in the already entrenched customers. It&amp;rsquo;s a very different world in networking today than when Cisco took the Lions share of the market. There is real competition. More competition. Cheaper competition with just an many features that is every bit as reliable. My opinion is that they need a complete rethink of their world, they have good, widely deployed products, leverage existing relationships and get some fresh ideas in.  Or buy someone with some.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy and flattered that this site actually proves to be useful to folks. It was always my intention to use this as a platform to try to give back a bit, to help with any data I may have run across that was interesting, useful, or obscure.  I utilize sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etherialmind.com&#34;&gt;etherialmind.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packetpushers.net&#34;&gt;packetpushers.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.evilrouters.net&#34;&gt;evilrouters.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwmetworkstatic.net&#34;&gt;networkstatic.net&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ioshints.info&#34;&gt;ioshints&lt;/a&gt; more than I can even measure.  I wanted to try to contribute as much as I could to pay it back.  So, seeing at it&amp;rsquo;s a new year and all, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist doing some data mining on the analytics of this site over the course of the last 12 months. I was once again surprised to see that a firewall post was clearly the most popular.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/sonicwall-old-dog-learns-some-new-tricks/&#34; title=&#34;Sonicwall – Old dog learns [some] new tricks&#34;&gt;recent post on the Sonicwall&lt;/a&gt; was the clear, overwhelming winner having more than twice the views as it&amp;rsquo;s closest rival. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rear_view_mirror.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;rear_view_mirror&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that, especially since most of what I do every day is routing and switching.  However, when this site was originally brought online back in 2008 (as tech.buraglio.com) to house my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/updating-srx-idp-signatures/&#34; title=&#34;Updating SRX IDP signatures&#34;&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/08/juniper-srx-cluster/&#34; title=&#34;Juniper SRX Cluster&#34;&gt;rough&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/srx-ipv6-flow-based-processing/&#34; title=&#34;SRX IPv6 flow based processing&#34;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/multicast-through-juniper-srx-5800/&#34; title=&#34;Multicast through Juniper SRX 5800&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/enabling-ipv6-on-juniper-srx-5800-cluster/&#34; title=&#34;Enabling IPv6 on Juniper SRX 5800 cluster&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/01/moving-junos-code-between-srx-cluster-nodes/&#34; title=&#34;Moving JunOS code between SRX cluster nodes&#34;&gt;Juniper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/02/upgrading-a-new-srx-3600/&#34; title=&#34;Upgrading a new SRX 3600&#34;&gt;SRX&lt;/a&gt; platform that I had the pleasure of being a very early adopter of, it was really obvious that folks wanted to see that data.  Those posts, although somewhat old, continue to be pretty popular. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/plexxi-could-be-wdm-for-the-rest-of-us/&#34; title=&#34;Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us.&#34;&gt;post on Plexxi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34; title=&#34;SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look&#34;&gt;post on SDN across the WAN&lt;/a&gt; are also pretty popular and both are subjects I will likely revisit as time permits. I&amp;rsquo;m working on many, many cool projects this year and I plan to write notes on every one of them.  Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to someone.   Welcome to 2013.  Let&amp;rsquo;s blow some minds, melt some faces and push some envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/random-tech-predictions-for-2013/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate feeling about &amp;ldquo;predictions&amp;rdquo; about the upcoming year, especially tech predictions.  I don&amp;rsquo;t like media sensationalism of any kind, and a lot of the tech predctions are just that, sensational, extreme talk to draw in readers or viewers.  I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to go down a more subtle path, these are things I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about lately but will likely forget in the upcoming year, unless they actually happen, in which case I&amp;rsquo;d likely do an &amp;ldquo;ah, I remember thinking that may happen&amp;rdquo; gesture.  Additionally, many of these things are well underway already, but I have a mind like a FIFO pipe, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write them down here to remember to go back and look at them in a few months.  They&amp;rsquo;re sort of a mixed bag of stuff, in no particular order. Lets call these, &amp;ldquo;plausible but not necessarily inevitable; possibly already happening&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/crystal-ball.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/crystal-ball.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;crystal-ball&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 1. Google buys or invests in a mobile carrier.  I was thinking Sprint, but T-Mobile makes more sense because of their GSM network and more global compatibility.  Thins kind of thing has been proposed many times over the last few years and it still makes sense. 2.  Apple buys or invests in Twitter.  This makes a lot of sense to me and would solidify their place in the social networking arena. 3. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aristanetworks.com&#34;&gt;Arista Networks &lt;/a&gt; moves into a larger data center and cloud computing role.  I see big things for this company. they have a very solid pedigree, have an innovative business model and a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; compelling product.   Which leads me to #4. 4. Talks of larger companies (Cisco, Juniper, Dell, Google) purchasing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aristanetworks.com&#34;&gt;Arista Networks&lt;/a&gt;.  This hapens to many of the very innnovative companies.  Remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procket_Networks&#34;&gt;Procket&lt;/a&gt;?  Yeah, most folks don&amp;rsquo;t.  I had the same thoughts about them.  cisco purchased, absorbed and buried them.  I believe their routing pieces were shoved into the nexus. 5. SDN controllers become more mainstream.  BigSwitch stands more or less unchallenged in the commercial controller space and has done it right.  Seed the opensource community and make a commercial product for those that want it (i.e. businesses that need support, don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with code).  It makes sense to me that this become a big market in the next few years, and next year will likely be the mad dash.  I expect to see SDN controllers from big names and hopefully some start ups. 6. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plexxi.com&#34;&gt;Plexxi&lt;/a&gt; starts to become a more well known name.  They&amp;rsquo;ve got a really cool product and a unique and innovative feature set.  I also wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if a big name tried to buy them. 7. More and more &amp;ldquo;Ethernet Fabric&amp;rdquo; products emerge.  This is the new marketing favorite son and there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnodal.com&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; new players here.  Sprinkle in SDN and &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo;, shake with &amp;ldquo;data center&amp;rdquo; and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a buzzword cocktail worthy of a king. 8. Productized optical (WDM) SDN starts to mature and become available. This is already happening in he background and on the periphery. 9. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crn.com/news/networking/240007827/microsoft-confirms-more-details-of-lync-skype-integration.htm&#34;&gt;Skype is integrated into MS Lync&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is really unexpected or a surprise at all since it&amp;rsquo;s been announced.  I think it&amp;rsquo;ll happen in 2013, though. 10.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstack.org&#34;&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; starts taking a more publicized role in production cloud computing.  This is sort of inevitable and obvious, I think, and it&amp;rsquo;s already starting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CentOS sshguard install for limiting ssh scans</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Securing SSH is a form or art.  It&amp;rsquo;s often debated, much like blocking all ICMP packets (which I normally disagree with).  If you need good proof, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://lonesysadmin.net/2012/11/20/changing-sshd-port-numbers-continues-to-be-a-bad-idea/&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://lonesysadmin.net/2012/10/19/on-using-alternate-ports-for-ssh/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/plankers&#34;&gt;Bob Plankers&lt;/a&gt;.  There is a camp that likes to promote moving to a non-standard port.  There is a faction that likes to block it completely except from a handful of hosts.  Then there are those that like to leave it open all together.  Running naked in the digital jungle. I tend to err on the side of blocking except for jump hosts.  This is a pretty time proven methodology.  However, what about the hosts that &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to be open? A hardened jump host or public shell box comes to mind. Enter &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sshguard.net&#34;&gt;sshguard&lt;/a&gt;. SSH Guard is an amazing little piece of software that takes the heavy lifting out of blocking all of those scans and automates removal of blocks.  It works across a myriad of popular unix platforms. From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sshguard.net&#34;&gt;http://www.sshguard.net&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Sshguard monitors servers from their logging activity. When logs convey that someone is doing a Bad Thing, sshguard reacts by blocking he/she/it for a bit. Sshguard has a touchy personality: when a naughty tyke insists disturbing your host, it reacts firmer and firmer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sshguard supports many services out of the box, recognizes severallog formats, and can operate many firewall systems. Many users appreciate its ease of use, compatibility and feature richness.&lt;/em&gt; I like it because they have not left out some of the less common distros, but sinceI&amp;rsquo;ve mostly converted over to CentOS, this focus is how to set it up on Centos 6.3.   We&amp;rsquo;ll assume you have epel repo and rpmforge repo installed. I prefer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng&#34;&gt;syslog-ng&lt;/a&gt; so lets install that.```
sudo yum -y install syslog-ng&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;chkconfig syslog-ng on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chkconfig rsyslog off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-This isn&#39;t necessary, but I&#39;d recommend it.

&lt;p&gt;Change the line that reads```
SELINUX=enabled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-to```&#34; data-lang=&#34;to```&#34;&gt;SELINUX=disabled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to reboot to make this take effect. Note that this will disable selinux completely and permanently.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.revsys.com/writings/quicktips/turn-off-selinux.html&#34;&gt;There are ways to temporarily disable it&lt;/a&gt; if you would prefer.```
sudo reboot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Download sshguard.  I didn&#39;t find it in any repos for Centos 6.x.  I may be mistaken, but I went this route.```&#34; data-lang=&#34;Download sshguard.  I didn&#39;t find it in any repos for Centos 6.x.  I may be mistaken, but I went this route.```&#34;&gt;wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshguard/files/sshguard/sshguard-1.5/sshguard-1.5.tar.bz2/download&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unpack it.```
bunzip2 sshguard-1.5.tar.bz2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar -xvf sshguard-1.5.tar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd sshguard-1.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-I like to do minimal installs of Linux, so I need to add gcc before I can compile.  This will likely install some dependancies if it&#39;s a new minimal install.  Same goes for make```&#34; data-lang=&#34;I like to do minimal installs of Linux, so I need to add gcc before I can compile.  This will likely install some dependancies if it&#39;s a new minimal install.  Same goes for make```&#34;&gt;sudo yum install gcc make
``````
sudo ./configure --with-firewall=iptables
``````
sudo make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo make install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, you should have it installed at this point.  You can verify by doing:```
ls -la /usr/local/sbin/sshguard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-which should yield something like this:```&#34; data-lang=&#34;which should yield something like this:```&#34;&gt;\-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 399995 Dec 16 02:28 /usr/local/sbin/sshguard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, now we need to create firewall tables for sshguard for IPv4, and if you&amp;rsquo;re keeping up to date, IPv6.```
sudo iptables -N sshguard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo ip6tables -N sshguard
```Now tell iptables to drop that traffic. Make sure you don&#39;t have a permit ssh rule above this line or it won&#39;t work.```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j sshguard
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -j sshguard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Save your config.  ```
sudo iptables-save &amp;lt; /etc/sysconfig/iptables
``````
sudo ip6tables-save &amp;lt; /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the examples below, we&amp;rsquo;ll just look at IPv4 to keep the post a bit shorter, but the v6 pieces are all identical save for the file names.  If you&amp;rsquo;re running v6 you should remember to secure it just as you would v4. Mine ruleset is pretty vanilla, mostly stock with the exception of ssl and dns.```

vi /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sshguard.net/docs/setup/getlogs/syslog-ng/&#34;&gt;instructions at the sshguard site&lt;/a&gt; (which also have details for extending this to more than just ssh; I&amp;rsquo;ll do a post on that for CentOS at some point too), just add the following to the bottom of your syslog-ng.conf file:```
# pass only entries with auth+authpriv facilities from programs other than sshguard
filter f_sshguard { facility(auth, authpriv) and not program(&amp;ldquo;sshguard&amp;rdquo;); };&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;pass-entries-built-with-this-format&#34;&gt;pass entries built with this format&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;destination sshguard {
 program(&amp;ldquo;/usr/local/sbin/sshguard&amp;rdquo;
 template(&amp;ldquo;$DATE $FULLHOST $MSGHDR$MESSAGE\n&amp;rdquo;)
 );
};
log { source(s_sys); filter(f_sshguard); destination(sshguard); };&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Then restart syslog-ng```&#34; data-lang=&#34;Then restart syslog-ng```&#34;&gt;sudo service syslog-ng stop
``````
sudo service syslog-ng start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll probably see these errors, they can be ignored if you&amp;rsquo;re not using the afsql module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Plugin module not found in &#39;module-path&#39;; module-path=&#39;/lib64/syslog-ng&#39;, module=&#39;afsql&#39;
``````
Starting syslog-ng: Plugin module not found in &#39;module-path&#39;; module-path=&#39;/lib64/syslog-ng&#39;, module=&#39;afsql&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ssh into localhost or in from an outside host. This will create a log and cause syslog-ng to call sshguard. At that point you should see this when looking for sshguard:```
ps auxww | grep sshguard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root 14010 0.0 0.0 16924 1260 ? Sl 20:49 0:00 /usr/local/sbin/sshguard
```You should see it in your iptables rules:```
\[buraglio@centos63 sysconfig\]# sudo iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination 
ACCEPT all -- anywhere anywhere state RELATED,ESTABLISHED 
sshguard all -- anywhere anywhere 
ACCEPT icmp -- anywhere anywhere 
ACCEPT all -- anywhere anywhere 
ACCEPT tcp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW tcp dpt:ssh 
ACCEPT tcp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW tcp dpt:https 
ACCEPT udp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW udp dpt:domain 
ACCEPT tcp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW tcp dpt:domain 
ACCEPT tcp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW tcp dpt:ndmp 
ACCEPT tcp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW tcp dpt:dnp 
REJECT all -- anywhere anywhere reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination
REJECT all &amp;ndash; anywhere anywhere reject-with icmp-host-prohibited&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chain sshguard (1 references)
target prot opt source destination
```That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. Let it sit and wait. It will block scanners automagically and then unblock them after a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/95/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many others, I rely heavily on my mobile devices to get my work done.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been a user of the iPhone since the original, with a year on a Nexus one android device.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have a strong preference and there are no &amp;ldquo;religious arguments&amp;rdquo; to be had with me on platform.  In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d probably choose PamlOS if I had a choice, it&amp;rsquo;s simple elegance and stability were a comfort to me&amp;hellip;it just didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to modernization. ..but I digress. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to go the Apple route, my machines are all Apple and so the integration makes sense.  That being said, there are a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; amount of apps to choose from on all of the major platforms.  Here are the ones that I find myself using, either for work or pleasure, on a weekly basis.  All of these apps are free and work across iPad and iPhone unless otherwise noted.   iSSH - SSH, VNC and RDC client.  Excellent.  $9.99 Works on iPad and iPhone Mail -Stock Twitter - Standard Twitter Client. Tapatalk -forum app $? Untappd - Socialize your drinking, I use it to take tasting notes (pinky up).  IPhone only PixelPipe - Send images to multiple destinations at once, good for backing up to flickr and picasa, etc.  iPhone only. Public Radio - Stream NPR. iPhone only Wootie - I gotta have my woot fix for the day. eBay - I also love me some eBay. Amazon - &amp;ldquo; &amp;rdquo; Grocery G. - Share a grocery list with the wife.  Very handy and does push notifications.  $2.99? Shop Savvy - A barcode scanner, saves to dropbox, compares prices.  Very handy. iPhone only Nixie Clock - Nixie tube-like alarm clock.  Can stream radio as an alarm.  iPhone only $.99 SpiderOak - Browse my SpiderOak backup.  iPhone only Box - I don&amp;rsquo;t use box as much personally, but my job has a deal with them. Dropbox - A &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have.  you all know what dropbox is. WebEx - iPhone WebeX client.  Works well. iPhone only(?) GoToMeeting - Same drill as WebEx Skype - for video and audo internationally and with folks that can&amp;rsquo;t do FaceTime. GV Connect - Google Voice client.  Works better than the Google app, supports multiple accounts. iPhone only $99 Plex - Amazing client for Plex Media Server.  Works well over cellular data, very well supported. $? NetFLix - you know what this is FlicksMan - Netflix Queue Manager.  Very well done. Lync 2010 - Connect to my works MS Lync instance.  Works well. Reminders - Stock app.  Clopud sync reminders / todo app.  I can&amp;rsquo;t live without it. BlueOn - Turn on (but not off) bluetooth in one click.  I use this a lot. DataVault - Password Store.  Encrypted Dropbox sync with deskatop app and other mobile apps. Note Taking - Notes app, Free.  I need an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting (back) to wordpress from Blogger</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/converting-back-to-wordpress-from-blogger/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 19:41:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/converting-back-to-wordpress-from-blogger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I ran a blog called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net&#34;&gt;tech.buraglio.com&lt;/a&gt; that was a self hosted wordpress site. After having kids and getting a bit busier at work, I decided to move everything that I had been hosting (images, scripts, hacks, blogs and DNS) to &amp;ldquo;the cloud&amp;rdquo;. I managed to do this for everything but my primary DNS resolver, which I had always intended to keep, and one &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shitenonions.com&#34;&gt;wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt; that I hosted for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bloggerpress.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bloggerpress-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;bloggerpress&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  I moved my image hosting from gallery2 to flickr (backup on picasaweb), secondary DNS to nether.net and afraid.org, scripts, hacks and the like to google code and my blogs to blogger.  Blogger was &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; easy, stable and highly available.  It was also far less flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.undertheradarblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Top-5-Best-Free-Cloud-Storage-Services-That-You-Need-And-Are-Useful.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to write from time to time, mostly ramblings or notes on some weird thing I has to set up.  I noticed that a few of my posts were getting a decent amount of traffic, something I was a bit surprised about.  I started to write a bit more&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;more traffic.  I started cross posting to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/buraglio&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.  More traffic.  OK, maybe what I was jotting down was actually useful to someone.  Or I had a stalker.  Probably not the latter. &lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.dreamhost.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/23-wordpress_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.decodeunicode.org/en/u+003e/data/glyph/196x196/003E.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Blogger.svg/256px-Blogger.svg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt; Since I already had apache working and serving other stuff, and one of them is another WP site, I already has MySQL running.  I just enabled SSL for the new domain that I had added and was ready to go.  I&amp;rsquo;m a really lazy sysadmin, so I used this as a reference. First, installing wordpress.  I chose the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion&#34;&gt;SVN install&lt;/a&gt; for easier upgrades down the road.  Upgrading WP was somethingI alweays hated doing, so I let it languish when I used it before.  At least now I should, in most cases, be able to just type &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;svn update&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to get it up to date (after verifying a back up, of course). After using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/blogger-importer/&#34;&gt;blogger importer&lt;/a&gt;, I had to go through and set all of my old blogger drafts to draft status again, wordpress has changed them all to published status. A minor detail. the rest  should be pretty straight forward, right?  Maybe not.  I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of twitter and bit.ly linking to my posts and I had a feedburner and quite a few RSS subscribers.  The feedburner stuff I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to have to write off.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds.feedburner.com/forwardingplane/WszR&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; needed to be more obvious as to what it was. The biggest thing I have to worry about is that Blogger formats it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pretty&amp;rdquo; links in a different way than wordpress.  Thankfully, however, I&amp;rsquo;m self gosting so I can use apache magic to fix this. &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; to the rescue. For every post, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to create a redirect entry in my .htaccess file.  Most of it is done, but for reference, here is what it looks like: &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-wan-novice-look.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/and-purple-pony.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/using-brocade-mlxe-as-replicator-to-ids.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/using-a-brocade-mlxe-as-a-replicator-to-an-ids/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/using-a-brocade-mlxe-as-a-replicator-to-an-ids/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/workflow-and-my-every-day-workstation.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/workflow-and-my-every-day-workstation-setup/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/workflow-and-my-every-day-workstation-setup/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/vdxrancid-contrib-scripts.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/vdxrancid-contrib-scripts/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/vdxrancid-contrib-scripts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/scinet-privileged-few.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/scinet-a-privileged-few/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/scinet-a-privileged-few/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/juniper-ex-4200-arp-ndp-problem-or.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/juniper-ex-4200-arp-ndp-problem-or-things-id-like-to-see-in-a-tac/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/juniper-ex-4200-arp-ndp-problem-or-things-id-like-to-see-in-a-tac/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/11/and-purple-pony.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/and-a-purple-pony/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/and-a-purple-pony/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/10/directionality_31.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/10/directionality/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/10/directionality/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/10/juniper-to-ios-conversion-chart.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/10/juniper-to-ios-conversion-chart/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/10/juniper-to-ios-conversion-chart/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Redirect 301 /2012/10/host-based-sflow-or-sflow-for-more-than.html &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/10/host-based-sflow-or-sflow-for-more-than-just-network-traffic/&#34;&gt;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/10/host-based-sflow-or-sflow-for-more-than-just-network-traffic/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;.and so on. I got really used to the google analytics, so I had to add a plugin for that.  I chose &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analyticator/&#34;&gt;Google Analyticator&lt;/a&gt;.  &amp;hellip;.Then I realized that users having to create  accounts is lame, so I added &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social-connect/&#34;&gt;Social Connect&lt;/a&gt;. So far, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it.  However, since this is a public unix box I need to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s relatively safe, so I would highly recommend installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sshguard.net&#34;&gt;sshguard&lt;/a&gt; in addition to whatever other firewall rules it can dynamically block offensive hosts and then unblock them after a period of time.  I am also a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.duosecurity.com&#34;&gt;duo security&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication&#34;&gt;two factor auth&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;     // &amp;lt;![CDATA[ google_ad_client = &amp;ldquo;ca-pub-5397547757892743&amp;rdquo;; /* Wordpress Small */ google_ad_slot = &amp;ldquo;7170585744&amp;rdquo;; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 15; // ]]&amp;gt; // &amp;lt;![CDATA[ // ]]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SDN across domains in the WAN - a novice look</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 05:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a flurry of discussion on SDN in the WAN lately, specifically, why and how.  Brent Salsbury laid out a few use cases &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkstatic.net/sdn-use-cases-for-service-providers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The why seems pretty straightforward.  I do believe it will happen, however, the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; is the interesting part.  Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m a tad of a greenhorn in the SDN space, I&amp;rsquo;ve made it work in a lab, I participate as much as I can in the working groups and I attempt (poorly) to keep up.   SDN, and likely OpenFlow, is in our roadmap at work.  Doing SDN in the data center is well documented and fairly well tested. Stanford has it all over their campus LAN and Google is pushing it around their walled garden WAN on custom built hardware.  None of this is new.   The interesting bit is &lt;strong&gt;how do you do it across multiple administrative entities&lt;/strong&gt;?  As I said before, I&amp;rsquo;ll never claim to be an SDN expert, so I need to break this down into simple pieces for my limited mind to comprehend.   BGP solved this years and years ago, how is that accomplished?  Can any of these bits be re-used (why re-invent the wheel)? My caveman mind wants to break this down into requirements: This can likely be controlled by access between peers via an access control mechanism of some sort, i.e. place software limits on how much a given peer can provision in your network, which can be broken down into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of circuits (MPLS, VLAN, DWDM Waves, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandwidth per circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of circuit (path TTL, permanent?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of devices involved per circuit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of SDN (OpenFlow versions, OSCARS, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably more stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be done?  I don&amp;rsquo;t currently know enough to answer that question, but I suspect it may require a little bit of work in adding a peering framework between control planes (SDN controllers) not unlike how BGP works.  To put this in familiar terminology, for example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route maps could be replaced by permissions maps or even an ACL of some sort to establish the abilities of each peer.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peers would need to agree (configuration-wise and politically) on what abilities can be exchanged before peers could operate, programmatically agree on parameters before any changes can be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security parameters would need to be met for the peers to establish to contain the control plane traffic in a safe way, much like an MD5 across a BGP peering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like a tall order, I&amp;rsquo;ll wager you&amp;rsquo;re right and I&amp;rsquo;ll also bet that before it happens we&amp;rsquo;ll have a Blu Ray vs HD-DCD or VHS vs Beta throw down of SDN protocols.   Folks have been trying to do this for years, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dragon.maxgigapop.net/twiki/bin/view/DRAGON/WebHome&#34;&gt;DRAGON project&lt;/a&gt; tried this years ago and did a decent job.  Our Arlington, VA site was one of the original build outs of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://oscars.es.net/OSCARS/docs/&#34;&gt;OSCARS&lt;/a&gt; is doing similar stuff and is actively working across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.es.net/&#34;&gt;ESnet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internet2.edu/ion/&#34;&gt;Internet2 ION&lt;/a&gt; is another attempt. These have all had their effect on the Research and Education networks, but to be adopted acrossm and more importantly between, service provider networks, there needs to be ways to do them elegantly and securely.  There is nothing that a SP hates more than risk, and without these control mechanisms, there is a pretty large amount of risk.  It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to think that this may be there and I&amp;rsquo;m just missing it, since I am admittedly a novice in the SDN world, but if by chance I have not missed it because it&amp;rsquo;s not there, it needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SCinet, a privileged few</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/scinet-a-privileged-few/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2012 11:12:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/scinet-a-privileged-few/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;     Every year there is an international conference for High Performance Computing, or HPC as it is often called.  This is a bit of a niche in that it&amp;rsquo;s something that many enterprises and researchers need but don&amp;rsquo;t do themselves and so many don&amp;rsquo;t have a grasp as to what all is invoved.  It&amp;rsquo;s a specialized,  potentially expensive and very different environment as well as mindset than the general sysadmin or network engineer will ever see.  The compute power is rated on it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.top500.org/&#34;&gt;own scale&lt;/a&gt; and it is very competitive.&lt;br /&gt;
    While this is a very interesting subject in and of itself, it&amp;rsquo;s not really the most compelling part of this corner of the technology world.  What &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the interesting piece is the foundation needed to make all of this work.  Compute power is obviously integral and I&amp;rsquo;ll never try to minimize its importance, but what happens when the huge data sets can&amp;rsquo;t get to the compute resources?  How do the big iron machines communicate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guessed it, it&amp;rsquo;s the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my career I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of cool networking projects.  One of them, however, stands out far and away more than the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bgjgEnK0U6s/UJyKPx1HLrI/AAAAAAABbBY/5ytF3GHKlX4/s1600/IMG_2417.JPG&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bgjgEnK0U6s/UJyKPx1HLrI/AAAAAAABbBY/5ytF3GHKlX4/s400/IMG_2417.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Building the network to support this conference is the real gem and real challenge.  A bit of history on this network called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCinet&#34;&gt;SCinet, can be found on WikiPedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;SCinet&lt;/strong&gt; is a high-performance &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking&#34;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; that is built, once a year, in support of the annual &lt;em&gt;International Conference for High Performance Computing and Communications&lt;/em&gt; also known as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputing_Conference&#34;&gt;Supercomputing Conference&lt;/a&gt;. It is the primary network for the conference and is used by attendees to demonstrate and test high-performance distributed applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originated in 1991 as an initiative within the SC conference to provide networking to attendees, SCinet has grown to become the &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Fastest Network&amp;rdquo; during the duration of the conference. Over the years, SCinet has been used as a platform to test networking technology and applications which have found their way into common use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At SC|05 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sc05.org/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, SCinet initiated a conference wide &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand&#34;&gt;InfiniBand&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure, combining various IB hardware vendors utilizing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OpenIB&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&#34;&gt;OpenIB&lt;/a&gt; software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous years, SCinet deployed conference wide networking technologies such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode&#34;&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_distributed_data_interface&#34;&gt;FDDI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HiPPi&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&#34;&gt;HiPPi&lt;/a&gt; before they were deployed commercially.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved since 2003, it made sense since my employer was a major supercomputing center, after all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in different capacities and different roles, Security, Wireless, UNIX services and routing.  The team that builds this amazing network do it because they want to.  It&amp;rsquo;s a labor of love.  It&amp;rsquo;s also an amazing experience.  This network, called &amp;ldquo;The worlds fastest network&amp;rdquo; on more than one occasion is built and torn down in less than a month.  The network has more bandwidth than some small countries, and it&amp;rsquo;s built specifically to support &lt;a href=&#34;http://supercomputing.org/&#34;&gt;this conference&lt;/a&gt; and the big science that gets demonstrated.  It&amp;rsquo;s always built with differentheterogeneous equipment.  It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing interoperability experiment that has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc12.supercomputing.org/content/scinet-contributors&#34;&gt;who&amp;rsquo;s who of big names&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    This is interesting and worth mentioning because it is an amazing feat that many never even know happens.  It is happening now.  It will happen again next year.  And it will be in a different location, with different gear and a different architecture.  If that&amp;rsquo;s not enough, it&amp;rsquo;s also got a &lt;a href=&#34;http://sc12.supercomputing.org/content/scinet-research-sandbox&#34;&gt;research sandbox&lt;/a&gt; for all of your SDN needs.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had my perfect world where I lived in a gumdrop house with lollypop trees and everything smelled like butterfly kisses, here is what I would like to see in WAN networking gear.   I can build a list for LAN and edge gear as well.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a golden rocket ship I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.  OK, maybe it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full MPLS support &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full IPv6 support, all the features, not just pieces.    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full VRF support &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LACP support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layer2 + Layer3, MPLS OpenFlow/SDN simultaneously on all hardware interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9000+ byte frame support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full instrumentation of software and hardware interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSPFv2/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mBGP4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multicast (MSDP, PIM-SM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flow export (IPFIX/V9 or sFlow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full ACL support on software and hardware interfaces, inbound and outbound, IPv4 and IPv6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v4 and v6 uRPF in all VRFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACL support for control plane services (ssh, snmp, telnet, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non Stop Routing in all VRFs, ideally in logical systems as well  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logical systems / Multi-Tenant routers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-Service Software Upgrade (Hitless upgrades)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for 4x the current global table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for 4x global IPv6 table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32+ nonblocking 10G interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4+ nonblocking 100G interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18000 byte frame support on 100G interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate control and forwarding plane and/or control plane policing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All supported routing protocols in non-default VRF and/or logical router&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenFlow/SDN support in non-default VRFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flow based policing on all software and hardware based interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to be able to turn all of this on at the same time &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone want all of these things, you may ask?  Not everyone is an enterprise customer.  Not everyone is an ISP.  Some of us are all of those things, plus more.  Not everyone has a brinks truck full of money to pour into layers of network gear.  Some people try to innovate and step outside of comfort zones to create new ways of doing things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the research and education realm, we actually *need* some, if not all, of these things.  Is there any chance we can get this?  Maybe, The MX series juniper makes comes pretty close.  The Brocade MLXe claims to do a good portion of this stuff on paper.  &amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what is in the Cisco portfolio that can come close.  ASR 9K?  You tell me.  Can the Arista do it?  It&amp;rsquo;s a linux box at it&amp;rsquo;s core so maybe, but are the buffers deep enough?  If you take out the OpenFlow bits the Alcatel-Lucent can probably do it.  H3C?  Maybe I live in a fantasy world.  Come on, folks, point me at something.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push limits or be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;    As I sit here thinking if this site is worth my time, some words that someone said to me recently ring true. &amp;ldquo;Take from things you&amp;rsquo;re doing every day&amp;rdquo; is what &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/networkstatic&#34;&gt;Brent Salisbury&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkstatic.net/&#34;&gt;networkstatic.net&lt;/a&gt; said to me. He was right.&lt;br /&gt;
    &amp;hellip;And it was why I originally started this site, in a way. The original goal was to make a site I could take notes on and possibly help out someone trying to solve the same issues as me or look at something from the same perspective I had.  I do a lot of self study and tinkering in my home lab.  I also do a lot of off the wall things day to day.  I also do occasional consulting, when it&amp;rsquo;s interesting.  Taking notes on these things is probably useful to at least someone.&lt;br /&gt;
    However, there is a lot of content out there saying a lot of the same stuff and in better, smarter and more digestible ways that I can. There are numerous Cisco focused sites that are far better than I could hope to produce in my nearly non-existent &amp;ldquo;free time&amp;rdquo;.  I know because I frequent many of them to help me.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ioshints.info/&#34;&gt;IOSHints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://networkingnerd.net/&#34;&gt;Networking Nerd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetlife.net/&#34;&gt;Packet Life&lt;/a&gt; are all fantastic resources.  Another of my favorite reads is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.evilrouters.net/&#34;&gt;Evil Routers&lt;/a&gt;.  It is sort of a unique bird, while the others are a tad cisco focused (not entirely, but mostly), &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jlgaddis&#34;&gt;Jeremy Gaddis&lt;/a&gt; throws in all kinds of amazing networking info in a well written manner and adds a significant amount of spice that is what I can only believe is his personality (I&amp;rsquo;ve never met him).  I can&amp;rsquo;t *not* read it.  I utilize these resource, in addition to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkstatic.net/&#34;&gt;Network Static&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetpushers.net/&#34;&gt;Packet Pushers&lt;/a&gt; almost daily.  I hope this can be a shadow of those sites.  If something from my never ending, incoherent rambling can help out one person in a tight bind or a day-to-day problem, then I&amp;rsquo;ll consider it a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Back to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    I am in a fairly unique environment in my day job.  The history of networking is very deep here.  Working for a major research university that has not only a major computing research facility, but one that was part of ARPAnet gives me (and anyone that works in this environment) a very unique perspective.  We have to support and secure the network as if it is an enterprise, but it also has to facilitate research.  Additionally, it needs to be extremely flexible yet also supportable.  And we&amp;rsquo;re a government entity, so we have to go to RFP for equipment, so we don&amp;rsquo;t get to pick and choose what we want.  If it meeds the technical requirements and budget, that is what we get.  Also, we just built out a Fiber to the premises ISP that won &lt;a href=&#34;http://uc2b.net/2012/09/13/uc2b-awarded-national-association-of-telecommunications-officers-and-advisors-natoa-2012-community-broadband-project-of-the-year/&#34;&gt;NATOA Broadband project of the year award&lt;/a&gt;, so we&amp;rsquo;re supporting a commercial ISP, too. Oh, we also don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge budget.  We need to be able to work on any network gear, security appliances, network related software packages or optical transport gear laid in front of us, and become experts on that gear in extremely short order.  We don&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury that many do in that we can throw something out if it&amp;rsquo;s not brand X or has a different take on a particular way of doing things.  It&amp;rsquo;s a little like consulting (from what I remember from 14 years ago) in that it&amp;rsquo;s probably something different every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    If you think these things are all diametrically opposed, you&amp;rsquo;re right.  Luckily we are blessed with a small but very clued and extremely diligent team.  I would consider us not unlike the spartans.  Few, but unwilling to fail and very long in drive to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    And that&amp;rsquo;s why I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   Enter this unkempt little corner of the internet.  Given that there is a bit of a lacking presence of non-cisco focused informational sites out there, maybe I can add some value&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;or at least not detract.  Lets start with two things I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful.  One is something I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for and never seem to bookmark.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&amp;amp;id=KB21476&#34;&gt;JTAC Recommended Junos Software Versions&lt;/a&gt;.  This is invaluable, and unless you&amp;rsquo;re doing something bleeding edge or edge case, this is a fantastic page to bookmark.  The other is a good resource for HP H3C networking gear.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jszc&#34;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; knows his stuff and likes to &lt;a href=&#34;http://thenetworkmonkey.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;share it on his blog&lt;/a&gt;.  He also knows a lot about other HP gear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A tale of two ISPs...</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-tale-of-two-isps/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2012 11:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-tale-of-two-isps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;     I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing research, carrier and service provider networking for a long time.  I my first real service provider experience was beta testing DSL for GTE back in the 1990s, I prototyped and proposed a CLEC for an employer in 1998 and went to work for the only ISP in the area rolling it&amp;rsquo;s own DSL over ATM in early 2000.&lt;br /&gt;
    Everything seems to come full circle, though, given enough time.  Right now I&amp;rsquo;m working on many projects, but two of them jumped out as particularly interesting when contrasted against each other.  Alone they&amp;rsquo;re interesting but not anything never done before.  When compared, however, they become are polar opposites in case studies.&lt;br /&gt;
    The first, a smaller mom-and-pop ISP that is now pretty much a WISP for only rural customers, was originally part of the ISP I rebuilt back in 2000.  They had not employed a network engineer after I left in 2002, but retained a good tech who had great skill with RF but not enough time to really learn the ins and outs of routing.&lt;br /&gt;
The infrastructure was mostly stagnant for about 10 years, adding a new switch or a box to do some traffic shaping, but it was, in essence, a very large layer 2 network with one router at the border.&lt;br /&gt;
    The other ISP is a bleeding edge winner of the broadband project of the year award, heavily funded and very innovative in nature, offering 1GBps fiber to the home and unlimited access to all local resources that want to connect.  &lt;br /&gt;
    I was the senior network engineer for the ISP 10 years ago and was appointed lead network engineer for the fiber ISP project.  It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that both came to my circle of view at the same time, as I work on the fiber ISP in my &amp;ldquo;day job&amp;rdquo; and rebuild the WISP at night in my spare time as a consultant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few take aways that I&amp;rsquo;ve [re-]discovered are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pfsense box makes a fantastic router for a smaller operation.  It also makes a completely acceptable replacement for a Cisco for far less money.&lt;br /&gt;
Even spending half a million dollars with Cisco does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; entitle you to any features that may be available in the SUP2T hardware (and not yet in the software).  Lame, cisco, lame.&lt;br /&gt;
HP procurve makes very nice Layer2 boxes with lifetime warranties.&lt;br /&gt;
Cutting over an ISP live really is not a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;
Not having PI address space is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;
Traffic shaping, rate limiting or QoS are possibly my least favorite thing to do now.&lt;br /&gt;
End users don&amp;rsquo;t care about IPv6 (boo! hiss!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the Cisco Sup2T doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually have software support for microflow policing yet&lt;br /&gt;
How to provision IPv6 RA through an Adtran TA5000&lt;br /&gt;
How to alias an overlay network on pfSense&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I can sleep when I&amp;rsquo;m dead =)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A quick post about ARP Networks hosting.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-quick-post-about-arp-networks-hosting/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 00:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-quick-post-about-arp-networks-hosting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a co-located server in one way or another for the last 11 years.  From hosting a bare metal box at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.soltec.net/&#34;&gt;ISP I worked for for a while&lt;/a&gt;, to sharing a bare metal box at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=layered%20tech&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.layeredtech.com%2F&amp;amp;ei=VTiwTuzyHPGDsgLIy_TCAQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGHUsG4YWgLSFwAwMC4E6zIIea5FQ&amp;amp;sig2=Xngd4LvUbIBFxPkV-cYvwA&#34;&gt;colo provider&lt;/a&gt; to switching to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://arpnetworks.com/&#34;&gt;VPS service&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an &amp;ldquo;offsite box&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
I just wanted to post a quick &amp;ldquo;these guys are great&amp;rdquo; comment to my current VPS provider, ARP Networks.  Not only do they have native IPv6, they also don&amp;rsquo;t oversell their VPS hosts and have unparalleled customer service and reliability.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had bad, bad, bad hosting service and I&amp;rsquo;ve had mediocre hosting service, and without question, I&amp;rsquo;m the happiest with ARP Networks.&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re in the market for a VPS, check them out.  Great pricing, fantastic customer service and a solid, reliable product make them the cream of the crop in this guys&amp;rsquo;s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a data point, I get no benefit from evangelizing their service, I just think it&amp;rsquo;s that good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A security oversight in Mail.app, or, a hidden bcc: field</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-security-oversight-in-mail-app-or-a-hidden-bcc-field/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2011 08:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/a-security-oversight-in-mail-app-or-a-hidden-bcc-field/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was poking around Mail.app, setting up my new machine. I like to keep redundant copies of everything, email being no exception. I have backups of all of my email dating back to 1998, for the most part. It has come in handy from time to time and I like it for reference reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s a small amount of actual data as far as space goes, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do. I remembered the days of using mutt for email (which really weren&amp;rsquo;t that long ago for me), and really liked the idea of setting a bcc of a separate address, not necessarily myself, but an email address inside of my administrative control, for CYA types of archiving. Upon looking, I saw no way to do this within the default apple Mail.app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing a bit of google searching, I found that this is pretty easily doable with a default write command. OK, awesome. This is good news. So I applied it:&lt;br /&gt;
(Open Terminal)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders &amp;lsquo;{&amp;ldquo;Bcc&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;archive-address@domain.com&amp;rdquo;; }&amp;lsquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done. Great. So, lets test it. Send email and check bcc&amp;rsquo;d address.  Email is there.  Strange, however, the bcc field doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up, or show anything at all.  That&amp;rsquo;s right, there is absolutely no indication that this email is being bcc&amp;rsquo;d to another address.&lt;br /&gt;
This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a problem for me, since I know that I set it up.  What it does mean, though, is that this could be applied to an unsuspecting user account, with absolutely &lt;strong&gt;no authentication necessary,&lt;/strong&gt; and have every outgoing message silently sent to a harvesting account.  There is no easy way to check for this that I have found save for using terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[buraglio@dalek:~ ] defaults read com.apple.mail UserHeaders                                   &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;{&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;    Bcc = &amp;ldquo;archive-address@domain.com&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, at least there is a way to tell.  Using the command &lt;em&gt;defaults read com.apple.mail UserHeaders&lt;/em&gt; from terminal will show the info, but the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s doable in such an obtuse way with no indication that mail is being bcc&amp;rsquo;d is a bit scary.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a preference pane that allows for tweaking of some of these &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s open source available &lt;a href=&#34;http://secrets.blacktree.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, called BlackTree Secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iMessage: I&#39;ve been left wanting</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/imessage-ive-been-left-wanting/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2011 20:37:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/imessage-ive-been-left-wanting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had very high hopes for iMessage. With the release of iOS 5, one of the big new features was iMessage, the ability to do Blackberry messenger style messaging on an iOS device. I had really hoped that this would be something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/treason/WifiSMS&#34;&gt;wifisms&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/5827451/desksms-is-the-best-phone+to+desktop-sms-solution-weve-seen-yet&#34;&gt;DeskSMS&lt;/a&gt; app for Android. At the very least I was hoping for iChat integration with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, iMessage is still really cool. I can see most of my contacts that have an iPhone or iOS 5 device on my iPad. Unfortunately, there are some significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to have the Apple ID of anyone that I want to be able to iMessage from my iPad. This can be problematic for a few reasons. Some folks use a role account for stuff like this, like a specific email address that is only used for that service. They may not want to share this address, or, more likely, I&amp;rsquo;ll add it as a contact and accidentally email this address at some point, which could result in delays or never getting a reply depending on how often this address is checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorization process of adding new addresses to iMesssage seems to be clunky and, in some cases, doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was also a bit put off by having (although not absolutely necessary) to add another email address in a username@me.com address. As an aside, I was happy to note that the ability to blanket forward all @me.com email to an existing email address. Very nice option, thanks Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iMessage doesn&amp;rsquo;t integrate contacts. If I iMessage from my phone using the 10 digit number, then message the apple ID, iMessage isn&amp;rsquo;t smart enough to integrate these together as a common contact. Instead, it shows them as separate threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; hoping for decent iMessage logging, available via iCloud, never mentioned but it was a pie-in-the-sky desire of mine for this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty disappointed with iMessage. However, I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic that some of these limitations will be addressed soonish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that would be nice to know, since this is being positioned as a &amp;ldquo;blackberry messenger replacement&amp;rdquo; is, what is the security policy on chat logs? I&amp;rsquo;m sure this is in the EULA somewhere, but I have yet to read it all. Does anyone have any condensed version? Maybe Im a bit naive, but my impression of BB messenger, and RIM services in general, seem to be pretty &amp;ldquo;on the side of the people&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gigaom.com/apple/ios-5-imessage/&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a decent write-up of the features and limitations of iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OSX (10.7; Lion) DHCPv6 client working with pfsense server.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/osx-10-7-lion-dhcpv6-client-working-with-pfsense-server/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It looks like MacOS 10.7 (Lion) has fully functioning DHCPv6. It&amp;rsquo;s about time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6FQwzCiawpg/TjDWmwrbONI/AAAAAAAAAEI/9mOtP9fMbqE/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2011-07-25%2Bat%2B8.45.24%2BPM.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6FQwzCiawpg/TjDWmwrbONI/AAAAAAAAAEI/9mOtP9fMbqE/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2011-07-25%2Bat%2B8.45.24%2BPM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-stFnUb3g1zI/TjDW1MDpOyI/AAAAAAAAAEY/YgG7fXCfujY/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2011-07-26%2Bat%2B7.18.45%2BAM.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-stFnUb3g1zI/TjDW1MDpOyI/AAAAAAAAAEY/YgG7fXCfujY/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2011-07-26%2Bat%2B7.18.45%2BAM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pfSense setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gSN5Rx7vIUU/TjDW0t1BcEI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/1hQNIlCJl30/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2011-07-26%2Bat%2B7.16.50%2BAM.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gSN5Rx7vIUU/TjDW0t1BcEI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/1hQNIlCJl30/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2011-07-26%2Bat%2B7.16.50%2BAM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server 4.2.1-P1 as the server (on my pfSense box) I am able to get not only a privacy address (via stateless autoconfigure) but also a normal EUI-64 address as well as an IPv6 address via dhcpv6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything except use the &amp;ldquo;Automatic&amp;rdquo; setting in the network control panel, so out of the box OSX 10.7 &amp;ldquo;Lion&amp;rdquo; looks like it does the right thing with DHCPv6, at least at face value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Better support for Linux (and annoyed about it)</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/better-support-for-linux-and-annoyed-about-it/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2011 08:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/better-support-for-linux-and-annoyed-about-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a *BSD user since around 1997, when I installed NetBSD on a Mac SE 30 that I got for free. I was always intrigued with alternative operating systems like BeOS, *BSD, Plan9 and Linux so it made sense that I&amp;rsquo;d poke around with different systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d gone back and forth from OpenBSD to FreeBSD but eventually settled on FreeBSD as my OS of choice. I ran it as a desktop before MacOS X came out and was generally happy with it. I learned most of the common flavors of Linux over the years out of curiosity and necessity but always went back to BSD for anything critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sad to say that I think this is changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a bit of a sell out, it was always cool to say I ran FreeBSD and to silently look at Linux users as nerdy dorks that were afraid of girls that lived in their mothers basement and talked about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds&#34;&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&#34;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; like they are demigods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I get busier both personally and professionally, it&amp;rsquo;s becoming more of a chore to manage a BSD system or a set of BSD systems. The ports collection is clunky and annoying to use once I saw the elegance of something like apt. The software support for the stuff I do every day either available for linux first or only available under linux. Network tunables like web100 are linux specific. HPC clusters are almost exclusively Linux. The straw that has broken the camels back is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thc.org/thc-ipv6/&#34;&gt;THC-IPv6&lt;/a&gt;. I had a need to do some IPv6 testing that required poking at equipment in a way that tests it&amp;rsquo;s metal. I needed tools to try to break the network and do other nefarious things. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thc.org/thc-ipv6/&#34;&gt;THC-IPv6&lt;/a&gt; fits the bill. It works ONLY under Linux due to the use of /proc. Yes, you can make /proc work under FreeBSD, but it&amp;rsquo;s annoying and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain that the code still won&amp;rsquo;t build without hackery that I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been poking around with Debian for years as an alternative for those things that just don&amp;rsquo;t run under BSD. The tools I need have been building fine under Debian and Ubuntu. It&amp;rsquo;s just *easy*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll still hold a place in my heart for BSD, I think the license it FAR superior (GPL has a host of issues that I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable with), but for now, Im going to have to &amp;ldquo;sell out&amp;rdquo; and use Linux. Mark the calendar, this is the day the music died.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Android (Nexus One) or iPhone?</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/android-nexus-one-or-iphone/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2010 09:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/android-nexus-one-or-iphone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;*Cross posted from my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickburaglio.com/&#34;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; since it&amp;rsquo;s a technical subject*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://handies.phandroid.com/media/nexus-one-1269816018-806.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://handies.phandroid.com/media/nexus-one-1269816018-806.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the million dollar question on many phone geeks minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone is really a love it or hate it kind of device, much like Apple stuff in general. Android, on the other hand, is still new enough that some folks are still ignoring it. Well, I wanted to know which worked better for me, and so I set out to test them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this test, I&amp;rsquo;m used an HTC Nexus One running both Stock and CyanogenMod firmware (Android 2.2) and an Apple iPhone 4 running iOS 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say, the results tha t I got were not what I expected. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a mac guy for a REALLY long time, even dating back to the Apple ][ days. That said, I&amp;rsquo;m not as religious about it as some folks are. I gave up my beloved PowerMac 7100 in favor of a BSD machine back in the 1990&amp;rsquo;s and have been a champion of the BSD OS ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little history, I&amp;rsquo;ve been an iPhone user since the 2g. I&amp;rsquo;ve done all of the jailbreaking and unlocking, even when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward and &amp;ldquo;one-click&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m also pretty familiar with Linux and I prefer a command line over a gui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that the Android phone would be a perfect next step for someone who likes to tinker with the UI, tweak settings and generally be able to control most aspects of his mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;.and that was mostly true. I LOVED the fact that my stuff was stored in the cloud. The fact that I could default my N1 and lock in as myself and all of my apps just showed back up with absolutely 0 user input (other than logging in) was awesome to me. A few apps had me totally sold. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.350nice.com/wp/products/picpush&#34;&gt;PicPush&lt;/a&gt;, for one, was a great app. Automatically doing things like pushing my images into the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; (flickr and picasa) was amazing. The one BIG deal to me, though, was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androlib.com/android.application.tv-studer-smssync-jjD.aspx&#34;&gt;SMS backup&lt;/a&gt;. the idea of always having my text messages backed up into my email, tagged and all, was too appealing to pass up. I LOVED this ability. I get a lot of txt messages and, unfortunately, a lot of important info comes in that way. The fact that I can have it show up somewhere else, backed up, with no work on my part was&amp;hellip;sublime. Simple Google voice integration was a huge plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://macosrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/iphone4-thumb-640xauto-14425.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://macosrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/iphone4-thumb-640xauto-14425.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Then I played with my wife&amp;rsquo;s iPhone 4. We did facetime with our son while away for a weekend. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tuaw.com/2010/09/17/gv-connect-app-for-google-voice-now-available/&#34;&gt;The allowed the Google Voice apps back in the iTunes store&lt;/a&gt;, so no more jailbreaking needed for useful apps. Backgrounding processes works. Multiple Exchange accounts now supported without jailbreaking and hacking the plist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*sigh*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a harder sell than I originally suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I set out to test my theory. I bought an iPhone 4 (after selling my 3g on ebay to ofset the cost). I fully expected that I&amp;rsquo;d like the N1 better. Simply comparing the hardware of the devices is pretty close, as described &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/compare.php?id%5B%5D=2520&amp;amp;id%5B%5D=2798&amp;amp;id%5B%5D=&amp;amp;id%5B%5D=&amp;amp;id%5B%5D=&#34;&gt;here at phonescoop.com&lt;/a&gt;. In my opinion (and for the things important to me) the phones really cancel each others strong points out with attributes like removable media and battery (N1) with better screen and MUCH better visibility in sunlight (iPhone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my rough (and obviously biased toward things I think are and aren&amp;rsquo;t important) rundown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: The iPhone has better resolution, far better visibility in the sun. &lt;strong&gt;iPhone, without question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps&lt;/strong&gt;: Close. Android has more tuning and tweaking apps, allows for the UI to be bent and molded. iPhone has FAR more apps and many are much more refined. My belief is that after Android has been around as long as the iPhone and in as many dev hands, this will level out and maybe even surpass (since apple isn&amp;rsquo;t strangling the dev abilities). &lt;strong&gt;Close, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to give this one to iPhone based on the sheer number and quality of apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Also close. I both love and hate that I need iTunes. Syncing my contacts, mail and calendars to the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; on my iPhone helps, but ultimately, probably slightly better for Android. Media sync kinda sucks for anyone that has bought straight into iTunes for cataloging music and movies. iPhoto support is nice, though. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doubletwist.com/&#34;&gt;DoubleTwist&lt;/a&gt; for Android is still buggy and lacks features in my experience. I use only UNIX and Mac, so I never looked into any windows software since it would only be foreign to me and I have not owned a windows machine in more than 10 years. In general, I&amp;rsquo;d probably have to give this one a tie based on the trade offs. &lt;strong&gt;For me, iPhone was the clear winner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media support&lt;/strong&gt;: Also a trade off. Android has WAY more codecs that it can support (especially if you use a cool custom ROM like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cyanogenmod.com/&#34;&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt;), but for someone that has been cataloging music with iTunes since it came out and has an ENORMOUS music and movie collection with smart playlists galore, iTunes support is the clear winner. (Obviously this one is clearly biased since I&amp;rsquo;ve bought into iTunes hook, line and sinker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editing 720p video right on my iPhone works seamlessly. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go with iPhone on this one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multimedia Messaging&lt;/strong&gt;: A minor or non issue for some but I use it a lot. FaceTime is amazing and we use it quite a bit. Sending MMS movies and uploading to youtube seems far better on the iPhone. I never could get MMS movies to work on my N1 and the upload to youtube was pretty rough, sometimes failing completely. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna give this one to the iPhone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;: Also tough. Mods have made Android very elegant. The ability to tweak the UI and add features is a clear advantage to me. However, the fact that Apple keeps a lockdown on that stuff means that I always have a consistant experience. The UI on the iPhone is obviously elegant and sleek. The trade offs (for me) cancel each other out. &lt;strong&gt;For my money this is going to have to be a tie.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;802.11 Network&lt;/strong&gt;: Both do 802.11N on the 2.4ghz band. Both do WPA2 enterprise. Nexus One can create a hotspot without me jailbreaking it and/or paying AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;strong&gt;Nexus One CLEAR winner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage:&lt;/strong&gt; My iPhone has 16G of storage total. ~14ish is usable. My N1 has 512M on board and a removable microSD card that is 16G. C&lt;strong&gt;learly the Nexus One wins this category for having removable media.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batter Life:&lt;/strong&gt; I get a lot of calls and txts (and email) all day. I can go about 2 days with the iPhone 4 with the same accounts configured and txt/data/phone usage as I get almost 24hours with the Nexus One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can charge the Nexus One with any standard MicroUSB cable and change out the battery with a fresh one. I can also replace the battery if it goes bad (easily). &lt;strong&gt;Advantage, Nexus One.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the jury is still out, as I still have both. Lately, though, I;ve been considering selling the N1 and getting an iPad. I do, however, believe that Android is probably going to grab a significant market share since there are a LOT of apple haters out there, and there are even more companies grabbing the OS since it&amp;rsquo;s open source.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with Brent Salisbury that re-introduced a bit of a hot button with me.  The term &amp;ldquo;next-generation&amp;rdquo; is over used and at this point arguably meaningless.  So many things are labeled &amp;ldquo;next-generation&amp;rdquo; that, while technically true, they may be the next in a line of product, the term has entered marketing typecast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Logical systems are something that JunOS has done very, very right.  Regardless of if you need to create segregated administrative domains, routing domains or just labbing something up, this is a fantastic tool in the Juniper toolbox.  If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have an MX series available for testing, you&amp;rsquo;re already half way there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been buried in stuff to work on lately.  The amazing part of this is that it is all very interesting and things I want to do and learn.  The exhausting part is that there is an overwhelming amount of it.  It is a good problem to have. The list of things goes on and on (and obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t do all of this stuff by myself, we have an amazing team) but the short list is a pretty tall order.  I need to really learn MPLS and deploy a decent sized MPLS network over the span of a state. There is an immeasurable amount of amazing research going on that needs unmolested network access (translated: no security appliances in line), so securing that in a supportable and efficient way is on the table. There is the normal day-to day. There is capacity planning and base lining. Then there are the interesting pieces of OpenFlow, SDN and disruptive technologies.  Try to keep up with that and do a day job.  Now try to do that with a family too.  Wait?  Where did my time for sleep and the gym go? You get the point. My caveman mind needs to optimize these things to be able to even function, so, I make patterns.  I have to create ways to relate one thing to the next so I can keep track of them.  It&amp;rsquo;s not always efficient but it works fairly well.  In doing so I had made this relation that OpenFlow was not really that different.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been around long enough that I remember doing frame relay and ATM on the wide area (and ATM even within data centers to servers).  I have been learning MPLS pretty intensely since my exposure to it was limited and ave spent significant time [when I should have been sleeping] to that technology.  Doing what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and learning what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned has revealed to me that none of this stuff is new. Everything that is old is new again. &amp;hellip;mostly. Reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://etherealmind.com/overlay-networking-is-more-and-better-while-ditching-the-toxic-sludge/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/etherealmind&#34;&gt;Greg Ferro&lt;/a&gt; about overlay networks solidified this for me. ATM and Frame Relay are not dissimilar to MPLS in many regards.  MPLS took something that worked ok and made it better.  OpenFlow is taking something that works and making it better. Mark Twain said it best, I think (paraphrased): &lt;em&gt;[&amp;hellip;For substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them; whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing. When a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand men — but we call it his speech, and really some exceedingly smail portion of it is his. But not enough to signify&amp;hellip;.]&lt;/em&gt; An original idea is very, very  rare. So why, then, are so many people afraid of change?  The only constant &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; change.  Case in point: IPv6.  Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m going to harp about IPv6.  We actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; it and yet, even today, there is still significant resistance.  Why is SDN and OpenFlow creating such a buzz?  Why is there such vehement resistance? I&amp;rsquo;ll wager that MPLS was met with similar regard when it was being proposed and developed.  I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen significant resistance to it on mailing lists within the last 6 months.  While agree that there is a place and time for everything, being open is key to success.  Just because something works doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that there aren&amp;rsquo;t better, stronger, faster, more efficient ways to accomplish it. Give those things a try and see, don&amp;rsquo;t write them off.  Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for someone else to test the water.  Jump in and test it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I made a Sup2T-XL very unhappy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have a need to push hardware to it&amp;rsquo;s limits.  Generally, I end up being one of those people.  I must admit, I enjoy seeing how far things can be pushed, especially when it yields new and or interesting gains or knowledge.  One of the things that I needed to do was to rate limit a large set of addresses, but to allow unfettered access to other resources.  It&amp;rsquo;s possible there may be a better way to do this, but all of my other attempts to do this failed.  MicroFlow policing would kinda make it work, but the code to do so isn&amp;rsquo;t all in there yet for the SUP2T in either IOS 12.x or 15.0.  So, given few other choices we forged ahead with the plan to add ACLs, class maps and policy maps to make this work. I knew we&amp;rsquo;d become resource strapped with this method, but until there was a better way, this was the path.  My IOS foo is admittedly  a tad weak these days working more on JunOS, so if these aren&amp;rsquo;t the optimal way to&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How the internet really works in practice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol&#34;&gt;Border Gateway Protocol&lt;/a&gt; (BGPv4) is the foundation of the modern internet. Without it we would still be in the information dark ages and interconnectivity as we know it would not exist. One would assume, quite incorrectly I might add, that this foundational protocol is robust, secure and optimally configured to shepherd us through the daily use of this critical resource. While BGP has the capability of being all of those things, in practice it&amp;rsquo;s really not done that way. This is not a new subject and certainly not the first time &lt;a href=&#34;http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/opinion/After-20-years-BGP-still-lacks-security-foundation&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it&lt;/a&gt;.  After reading the very excellent packet pushers series on how the internet works by &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetpushers.net/author/rwhite/&#34;&gt;Russ White&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://packetpushers.net/routing-resilience-manifesto/&#34;&gt;Routing resilience manifesto&lt;/a&gt; is quite fantastic and should be consumed by anyone running a network that utilizes BGP, particularly eBGP, because since 1997 I&amp;rsquo;ve seen far more networks that don&amp;rsquo;t follow these practices than ones that do. BGP is one of those mechanisms that is, unfortunately, often done as a set and forget task. And herein lies the problem. I choose to think of it as a policy framework]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much less noise.  That was my initial thought when this box was first powered.  The 4500 sounds like a jet engine.  I was particularly excited about the Juniper EX4550 because it addressed a number of things that were less than ideal about the EX4500. Soem of the differences ciuyld be argued as either oa pro or con depending on deployment scanerio, but for what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for, the 4550 is far better. 4550 Single PFE, 4500 dual PFE Single PFE being more desirable for us since cross box traffic doesn&amp;rsquo;t potentially need to transit across another PFE introducing a tad more latency. ## Dual power supply in the 4550.  This one is a no brainer for us.  Redundancy is better. 32 line rate 1G/10G ports on the 4550.  40 on the 4500.  32 is plenty for us and is a worth while trade to get a single PFE. Ours came with JUNOS 12.2R1.8. root@EX-4550&amp;gt; show chassis hardware Hardware inventory: Item     Version     Part number Serial number Description Chassis LX0212450466 EX4550-32F Routing Engine 0 REV 12 750-045402 LX0212450466 EX4550-32F FPC 0 REV 12 750-045402 LX0212450466 EX4550-32F CPU BUILTIN BUILTIN FPC CPU PIC 0 BUILTIN BUILTIN 32x 1G/10G SFP/SFP+ Xcvr 31 NON-JNPR AN07452H1V SFP-T Power Supply 0 REV 03 740-044332 1G032240641 JPSU-650W-AC-AFI Power Supply 1 REV 03 740-044332 1G032240660 JPSU-650W-AC-AFI Fan Tray Fan Module, Airflow In (AFI)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Networks are insecure. Here&#39;s why.</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/1409/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/post/1409/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Networks are insecure, they just are. I once worked with an FBI agent who said that if you wanted a secure network you should turn everything off, smash it, then set it on fire - and I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree. However, there are things we can do to understand our networks that will aid immeasurably in how they are secured and initially and how they remain secured over time. At their very core networks are not secure based simply on the fact that humans are involved in their construction, operation, and use.  Recently, ICS-CERT released their annual report detailing the state of critical infrastructure and their report details exactly what anyone in the trenches should already know: &lt;strong&gt;we don&amp;rsquo;t pay enough attention to this stuff&lt;/strong&gt;.  Their assessment pointed out some pretty glaring holes, most of which we probably already knew (or should have) and some of which we may need to spend time learning about. In our never-ending quest for convenient, ubiquitous access to all things, we often forget to think about the little things, the &amp;ldquo;dirty jobs&amp;rdquo; of IT. Ive said it so many times I&amp;rsquo;m almost sick of hearing it myself: &lt;strong&gt;building a network is easy, running a network is hard.&lt;/strong&gt; Strip away all of the shiny, hype machine, marketing generated razzmatazz surrounding all things &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;SDN&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;intent-driven&amp;rdquo;. Those things are great and I&amp;rsquo;m neck deep in a lot of them, but building fancy things on broken foundations is clearly a bad idea, and a lot of what I see in the trenches is just that: broken, neglected, outdated, or just plain done poorly or done well and never maintained. When most people think about maintaining a network ecosystem they probably imagine plumbing vlans, changing peerings, creating LSPs or adjusting switchports. Realistically, that&amp;rsquo;s a tiny part of operations. In reality, most network issues could either be more easily solved by better understanding of a complex system or, in many cases, avoided completely by &lt;strong&gt;knowing your network&lt;/strong&gt;. When I say &amp;ldquo;avoided completely&amp;rdquo;, what I mean is that be knowing the baseline of something you can identify deviations from that baseline which can indicate an issue that needs to be addresses. It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I fiormly believe that the key to operating anything in IT is complete visibility and baselining of every facet that can be recorded, and I also assert that you cannot secure something until you truly understand not only how it works but how it fails. Anything less is an exercise in risk management. So, to that end, I will give a brief outline of what I believe is a foundation that we should all start from when building network analytics and monitoring.   A gigantic swath of this issue can be alleviated be three things: Knowing your network, Access control of your network, and attention to your network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network flow data (netflow, jflow, sflow, ipfix)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized logging of *all* devices on the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic statistics (interface counters, error counters, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration management of all network devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Template configurations for all commonly configured items (common firewall filters, RE filtering, apply groups, ZTP, VM templates, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS query data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency and jitter information to/from all key locations in the network, including ingress/egress of the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routing table information (IGP and EGP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optical power readings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware inventory (linecards, serial numbers, chassis models)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental data (heat, power, cooling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full packet capture at network egress (if possible - ISPs obviously cannot realistically do this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anomalous policy / signature detection at all strategic locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now you have the firehose. That&amp;rsquo;s actually the easy part. Now, once you have this data you have to keep it up to date and keep watching it. Given the nature of what it is, you&amp;rsquo;re likely going to have to visit several systems to monitor it. There are some &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; packages that can do a lot of it, librenms can tie together a bunch of these elements, as cam&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SDN gateways have a much more traditional look and feel. They have a flat SDN OpenFlow network with a default gateway for client traffic by either controller proxy or direct reachability by the client host. Note that both approaches suffer from lack of adoption and maturity, which adds risk to any early production SDN.  IPv6-like&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this by saying that this was an experiment for me.  That said, I know there are folks that want to run everything under the sun on a pi.  So, since I love the platform as well, I set out to try to make the raspberry pi a perfsonar &amp;ldquo;probe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SD-WAN: The service provider perspective.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The SDN sites are all abuzz with talk about how your enterprise network can take advantage of the deluge of new products and services out there aimed at that market, and that&amp;rsquo;s great - there are some cool options out there for that space. But, like I always do, I want to talk about the other pieces that most people do not see. The gritty plumbing and complex interconnections of the last mile providers, because there are a lot of very interesting moving parts there that the typical data center engineers don&amp;rsquo;t see, care about, or perhaps even know exist. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on things like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2016/10/care-segment-routing/&#34;&gt;Segment Routing&lt;/a&gt; and how it plays into the complex ISP world. This is really just the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The unrealized expectations of SDN</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/post/1374/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been remiss in writing in the last year, the reasons are unimportant, but regardless, I&amp;rsquo;ve been paying very close attention. It&amp;rsquo;s 2017 and it is SOAPBOX time again!  SDN has been a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; since ~&lt;a href=&#34;http://archive.openflow.org/documents/openflow-wp-latest.pdf&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, with the publication and popularization of the OpenFlow protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s 2017. How much has this industry changing technology is running outside of the hyper scale data centers?  We&amp;rsquo;ve seen companies rise and companies disappear. The promise of SDN is multi-faceted, but aside from automation and orchestration, the draw for many architects and engineers is the idea of modular control and data planes. The switching pieces in the data center work - for the most part. The promise of SDN may work for the hyperscalers - but what that does that mean for everyone else other than better cloud services? I&amp;rsquo;m going to discount enterprise, mostly, because enterprise, frankly, is slow to change and glacial when it comes to adopting new internal technologies, but that only serves to prove my point - it&amp;rsquo;s not there yet. That leaves my favorite subject: service providers - and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean SD-WAN (that&amp;rsquo;s something completely different and  don&amp;rsquo;t accept the name as correct). The idea of taking a routing stack and a forwarding plane and breaking them apart, making them interchangeable and modular. This requires a few elemental attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong routing stack including the venerable legacy protocols such as mBGP, IS-IS, LDP, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full support of the routed stack (IPv4 and IPv6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robust hardware platform with appropriate buffers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to couple the two in a stable and supportable way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds simple. It&amp;rsquo;s not. Think about this from the perspective of the commercial UNIX systems of 20 years ago. The custom hardware did not always have compatibility with the software packages that the engineers needed to run on them. The implementations were clunky and sometimes half-done. Features didn&amp;rsquo;t always work. Updates were staggered, haphazard, and slow. This is what SDN has felt like for me for the past few years. Sure, if you&amp;rsquo;re in the data center and you want a single vendor solution - maybe. In my world that&amp;rsquo;s not ever the case, and I assert that if things don&amp;rsquo;t interoperate then they are incomplete. Where am I going with this rambling, nonsensical drivel? Hardware features and software features have a history of not matching when something is new and SDN has been the embodiment of that. If I look back on the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the SDN space, and at the risk of being captain obvious, the lessons learned that come to mind from my experience designing, coordinating, building, and running actual production SDN networks are pretty easy to point out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized control doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well geographically (or arguably at all).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topology information is difficult to track in a timely manner in the WAN. See bullet 1. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/captain-obvious.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/captain-obvious.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-inventing protocols stinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the issues revolve around scaling and support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling is hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All hardware is most certainly not created equally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room is that WAN gear is different. It&amp;rsquo;s historically been custom ASICs, sometimes FPGAs, and always has deep buffers. It also has a longer mean time before replacement. This is incongruent with the think buffered data center switches that most folks experiment with if they ever make it past &lt;a href=&#34;http://mininet.org/&#34;&gt;mininet&lt;/a&gt;. Want to understand buffering and why it is necessary? Read up &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/buffer.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s the best resource I&amp;rsquo;ve ever found on buffers of tons and tons of gear. The cliff&amp;rsquo;s notes are that when networks have a longer RTT, they need more buffering. TL/DR? Don&amp;rsquo;t use a freaking data center switch as your border router. Just because it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; run BGP doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve seemingly called all of the babies ugly, let me shine a bit of light. I do have hope for some SDN. I think it exists now in the form of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forwardingplane.net/2016/10/care-segment-routing/&#34;&gt;segment routing&lt;/a&gt;. Because we&amp;rsquo;ve seen the trying to turn an aircraft carrier on a dime is not easy, we can learn from it. There are a handful of solid SDN based WAN boxes out there and they bring strong offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The networking world has been abuzz with talk of VMWares NSX announcement, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/limitations-of-a-software-only-approach-to-data-center-networking/&#34;&gt;Cisco&amp;rsquo;s CTO response&lt;/a&gt; to that, and heavy speculation of what that means.  If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about NSX, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/ioshints&#34;&gt;Ivan Pepelnjak&lt;/a&gt; over at ioshints has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ipspace.net/2013/08/what-is-vmware-nsx.html&#34;&gt;great write up&lt;/a&gt; explaining what it is and isn&amp;rsquo;t.  I enjoyed the read quite a bit. Speculation generally makes me jittery, so I have spent some time thinking about this, reading and trying to understand. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that  I am by no means an expert in enterprise networking.  That being said, some of the responses to these arguably groundbreaking announcements are troubling to me. Let me preface this by saying that I lean more towards the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&#34;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; style than the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_%28CEO%29&#34;&gt;John Chambers&lt;/a&gt; mindset (although I&amp;rsquo;ll always claim to be more like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickburaglio.com/2013/08/24/boba-fett-1981/&#34;&gt;Boba Fett&lt;/a&gt;). I am not a fan of being forced into an ecosystem.  I like open, standard protocols.  This is why the&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenFlow is a game changer, no question about it. With all of the buzz about it, I really don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;re seeing past its real value, most are focusing on the data center and potentially not seeing the forest for the trees.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about the gooey center of the data center. I&amp;rsquo;ve built, maintained, consulted on or in some way supported so many HPC data centers in the last 12 years that I find them dull at this point*.         *With the exception of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/bluewaters&#34;&gt;Blue Waters petascale machine&lt;/a&gt;.  BW has pushed limits of networking, security and computing at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
