In [this episode](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/ipv6-buzz/ipb170-rfc-7050-vs-rfc-8781-for-ipv6-prefix-discovery/) of the IPv6 Buzz, we dive into two RFCs for discovering IPv6 prefixes: [RFC7050](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7050) and [RFC8781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8781). Why these two? First, [8781 is being proposed as preferential to 7050](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-v6ops-prefer8781/). Second, I happen to be a co-author on the draft that proposes the preference for 8781 and as usual, I have "insights" to share.

We start with some background on RFC 7050, including the limitations that led to the development of RFC 8781. Benefits of the newer RFC include efficiency and security. We also look at the challenges of managing network configurations in large enterprises and the advantages of centralizing configurations on routers. We conclude with a call to action for network operators to review and comment on RFC 8781.
