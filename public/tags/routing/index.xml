      <title>The BGP conundrum</title>

      <description>BGP. It’s that magical protocol that runs the internet. For for as much as BGP is a fundamental, critical, irreplaceable part of the core functioning of the internet, it is a protocol that has not aged well as far as security is concerned. See, BGP was born when the internet was really still an academic experiment. Handshakes and loose agreements were totally fine for connecting a new site. Then came the awakening.</description>

      <title>FreeRouter as a test environment</title>

      <description>A few months ago Kevin Myers of IP Architechs introduced me to a really interesting project called FreeRouter. Being that I absolutely love alternative routing platforms and feature complete simulation environments, this really got me going. I tend to define &amp;ldquo;feature complete&amp;rdquo; in a routing platform as something that can do both IS-IS and MPLS. Given that there aren&amp;rsquo;t many platforms that do both correctly or within a reasonable budget, and offer simulation options, I was pretty excited.</description>

Hi Nick, I&amp;rsquo;m not a WAN routing guy so this may be a ridiculous question but I&amp;rsquo;m curious how you would compare/contrast segment routing with shortest path bridging. From the little I know, the goals seem awfully similar.</description>

      <description>Edit: Going against my normal “just get the content out there” methodology, I’ve been mulling over this blog post since July of 2016. Segment routing is such a beautifully elegant solution I have had trouble articulating that fact. WAN technologies are squarely within my wheelhouse, and this one fits in so well I was going over and over the post never really satisfied with it, continuing to find mistakes and decided to just get it out there.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s almost always the organisational part that is the hard part. Look at DNSSEC, the technical part is easy to deploy these days: see PowerDNS for example. Now getting someone in your organisation to deal with DS-record and know what to do when migrating a domain&amp;hellip; well, that&amp;rsquo;s a whole process, that&amp;rsquo;s the difficult part of the story. I do however believe it could be simpler though.</description>

      <description>Image created from SURFNet RPKI page.         I was recently at a meeting where BGP RPKI was the topic de jour. While this has been a topic that I have visited on occasion of the last few years and something I wanted to spend significant time on, I have found that setting aside the time has been difficult and sparse, much like the deployment of BGP RPKI.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I wrote some text on interdomain SDN. Years later, work is being done, smart people are thinking about it and building ways to make it a reality. Not being one to give up on an idea, I gave this presentation in may at ChiNOG on what my take on what that architecture should be. I (we) propose that the use of existing protocols such as BGP FlowSpec will make this realistically deployable and maintainable given some simple, pluggable middleware.</description>

      <description>For those that run BGP networks, BGPmon is often a tool they turn to for some really unique and hard to find information. Remember back in February 2008 when Pakistan Telecom &amp;ldquo;blocked&amp;rdquo; Youtube? That one was a really, really public example of something that BGPMon caught. BGPmon has been around for a long, long time. Quietly watching prefixes. Silently noting changes and reporting them to the ones lucky enough to know of its existence.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to attendin the past and have done some remote participation when possible, but like some of the other rare opportunities I have had in my career, NFD is fairly unique in that it is constantly evolving in both the information provided and the individuals involved.

Wow. I completely disagree. Just because a firewall can give you some headaches in your network environment it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a reason to just dump it. A very dangerous proposition, and your &amp;ldquo;alternatives&amp;rdquo; will not be enough. Fix your firewall if it causes issues. Nick Buraglio - Sep 1, 2014
Like I said, it&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone, but there are very real use cases where there is no hardware firewall that does what is necessary.</description>

      <description>I admit that the title was meant to be inflammatory. However, there are use cases that aren&amp;rsquo;t terribly uncommon where an in-line security appliance is just not the correct tool for the job. Someone once told me &amp;ldquo;a firewall protects a network like a fuse protects an electrical circuit&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a correct statement. Firewall vendors will probably argue this and enterprise folks may discount this as heresy and call for burning me at the stake.</description>

&amp;ldquo;I would like to say that it will help the adoption of IPv6, because it may bring some attention to the fact that IPv4 addresses are being exhausted, but IPv6 has completely failed to take off,&amp;rdquo; Cowie said. &amp;ldquo;If anything, it really shows you that IPv4 has really never been healthier.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that this is a true statement, but history has shown that people only try to prolong the inevitable IPv6 deployment.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve blathered on about BGP forever. Say what you will about the venerable protocol, it runs the interwebs, is reliable, extendable and well documented. I&amp;rsquo;ve also espoused&amp;rdquo;) ad nauseam about IPv6, so none of this [admitted] rant should really be a surprise coming from me. As of 8/12/2014, according to the CIRD report (and many mailing lists), the default free global ipv4 routing table has reached 512k routes. This is a milestone from many perspectives, but more importantly, it solidifies the fact that there is a great deal of equipment in critical points in the internet that is out of date and cannot perform as intended in its current configuration or function.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t care what your vendor alignment of choice is, Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, Alcatel&amp;hellip;.it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. At one point or another you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to bird dog an address to see where it&amp;rsquo;s coming from, who owns it, what it&amp;rsquo;s DNS name is or what path you&amp;rsquo;re taking to get to it. We&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about BGP tools, they&amp;rsquo;re a great choice for checking routes across the internet. Hunting down addresses is an interesting one, though, as address management and lookups can bleed into other aspects of networking like path selection, latency, jitter and many other things.</description>

Another great site that should probably be on the &amp;ldquo;notable mentions&amp;rdquo; is the CIDR report. CIDR report provides a nice, easy to read and up to date breakdown of the global routing table for both IPv4 and IPv6. Great to utilize for trending and planning if you&amp;rsquo;re not monitoring your own tables (which you should be) and as an impartial data source for the global table.</description>

      <description>Time to rewind from the new and shiny and get back to roots of networking. BGP is one of those odd protocols that is foundational to the functioning of the internet but yet somewhat hard to get experience with. Say what you will about this venerable protocol, it&amp;rsquo;s been here a while and it is not going anywhere any time soon. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing BGP since around late 1999, and I completely fell into it by accident, having only the Cisco Internet Routing Architectures book (which I literally read cover to cover) and the Ulysses Black Routing Protocols Book and whatever I could find on a random search engine to guide me, and that was only after having to learn on the CLI for the first 6-7 months.</description>

      <description>“Hopefully there are some things here that will make you really upset in a very good way” is how Carl Moberg of Swedish based company tail-f opened up to the crowd at Networking Field Day 7 on Feb 19, 2014. Tail-f is a sleeper, I had actually never heard of them before NFD7, but they&amp;rsquo;ve got a very unique product in NCS and in my opinion it can change the way existing and future networks are managed.</description>

      <description>[poohead]( &amp;ldquo;stuff@stuff.com&amp;rdquo;) - Sep 5, 2013
Great post! Like all SolarWinds products, the Netflow Analyzer is subpar at best. It has major scalability and performance problems (most likely due to to way it uses its SQL database) that make it unusable for actual troubleshooting. And no matter how many new widgets and features they add to their interface, the graphs are still unreadable. I am of the opinion that any network reporting tool that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the RRD/MRTG-style graphs is almost worthless.</description>

      <description>One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve always lamented about using non-Cisco hardware is the lack of true 1:1 netflow support. Say what you will about jflow, cflow, sflow&amp;hellip;.there is no substitute for netflow, with sflow being the exception to that since it is a protocol that inherently supports ipv6 and can transport far more than simple network information if configured in certain ways on certain devices. On newer MX series Juniper routers the game has changed.</description>

      <description>Working on some MX series routers recently I encountered a problem I&amp;rsquo;d never seen before, essentially preventing the configuration from being committed:``` buraglio@rtr# commit check re0: error: could not open configuration database (juniper.data+)
buraglio@rtr&amp;gt;start shell From there I wanted to see the file system and check out the stats of what it thinks we have.``` buraglio@rtr% df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Capacity Mounted on /dev/ad0s1a 3.5G 313M 2.9G 10% / devfs 1.</description>

      <description>I recently had the need to debug a run away ip_rx process on an older Brocade MLX. For anyone that has had to do any type of low level debugging on the Brocade (Foundry) platform, you know that there many somewhat deep level diagnostics that are possible. The debug (like cisco debug) is a bit lacking, but the dm, LP and MP commands are very useful (and a tad scary). Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to utilize them a lot in the last few years so my aversion to using them has been pretty much completely callused over.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of MPLS in the last 45 or so days (which is one of the reasons I have been absentee in the OpenFlow world lately). Having had almost no real world MPLS experience aside from a handful of pseudo-wires and a very small LDP signaled network, I had to spend some time reading, hacking at routers and essentially learning. In doing so, I found a few things.</description>

      <description>I love to be the &amp;ldquo;uncola&amp;rdquo; of networking sites. I like interop and I don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot with Cisco because I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to much of their gear anymore. So, that being the case, I had a need to bring up a l2circuit (in JunOS speak), or VLL (in Brocade speak) between an MX480 and an MLX. Since they are very different platforms, I had to do some digging and playing around to get it to work.</description>

The qfabric stuff seems even more green than the EX series. Perhaps i should give it another look, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the best experience with it in testing. My guess is the mpls support will be about the same as the EX series, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly one I did not consider. Thanks, I will give it another once over.

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the fact that there seems to be a lack of options in a very specific product level. Lets say you have a network that looks like this: Right Away you&amp;rsquo;re limited since you need MPLS and more than 2 10G interfaces. Even more so if you require full support for IPv6 and ISIS. If budget is of any concern, you&amp;rsquo;re in real trouble. For many, Cisco pricing and smartnet is potentially going to exclude anything reasonable from them.</description>

      <description>I started working on Juniper equipment around 2002. At my employer, we had an M40 with the serial number 256. We did Layer3 only. I had no idea if the Juniper even did layer2. It certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a layer3 switch like a 6500 like I was used to. It was like a deliciously robust version of any Layer 3 router I&amp;rsquo;d worked on previously. Over the years Juniper has added a switching line utilizing their FreeBSD based OS, JunOS.</description>

      <description>Tyler Christiansen - Mar 6, 2013
So what happens when the circuit to the one transit provider providing a default IPv6 route drops? Or if instability is otherwise introduced? Nick Buraglio - Mar 6, 2013
That is a known limit. One could have default from &amp;gt;1 provider or not have had to do this in the first place, ideally. In this particular instance, there is only one provider that can truly give default (cogent isn&amp;rsquo;t a full v6 table regardless of what they say) and the rest are close but not full.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently run into a situation where there was no longer enough space in the FIB to handle both the full IPv4 global table and the full IPv6 global table. We prefer to run a default-free network within this particular SP network, but in this case, until a hardware refresh can happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to adjust that. Given what we knew about the size of both tables, it made more sense to take a default IPv6 route from one transit provider and filter the rest.</description>

      <description>Recently we encountered a very strange behavior on an SRX 5800 cluster. The cluster, which is in active/active mode, started dropping OSPF adjacencies to it&amp;rsquo;s neighboring routing equipment, in this case, Juniper MX480 and Brocade/Foundry MLX8. Strange behavior indeed, since for us, these had been rock solid for around 2 years and we&amp;rsquo;d never seen this odd behavior before. Honestly, we started looking at the routers first since this was something the SRX has never done before.</description>

      <description>Have you ever needed to replicate a lot of data transparently to an IDS without the use of a rack of optical taps? Not enough budget for a Gigamon or cPacket? Have a spare MLXe laying around? you&amp;rsquo;re in luck, we were in that boat too. Let me first preface this by saying that this would be fairly trivial using OpenFlow / SDN. That being said, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to set that up, so this is what we came with.</description>

      <description>Recently we&amp;rsquo;ve run into an odd issue while routing on an EX4200 series. These little JunOS boxes are a nice alternative for an entry level building router, they support L2/L3 functionality, a PVST+-ish protocol and, with advanced licensing, IPv6, ISIS and BGP. They have multi 10G interface options and come in a pluggable fiber option. We use them all over for light layer 3. They can also be stacked via stacking cables and fiber, which is very handy and makes them extremely versatile but not really applicable for the purpose of this entry.</description>

      <description>Moving to JunOS from IOS can be a daunting task. It&amp;rsquo;s a completely different command structure and the config, by default, looks like a programming language. I was fortunate enough to have gotten in on using JunOS very early in my career, 1&amp;frasl;3 in to be exact (as of this writing). Not to mention that wen I got started, IOS wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only game in town. Remember Xylan? Gandalf? OpenRoute?</description>

You can configure it and it applies as a service policy, but even though outbound is &amp;ldquo;supported in hardware on the Supervisor2TXL&amp;rdquo;, there is no software support for it in either the 15.0SY or 12.2(50)SY. It took me a month to suss this out&amp;hellip;..
Yes, I should have suspected. I dont work on Cisco every day, I have Juniper MX, Brocade MLX and a multitude of other platforms to work on daily, so it took a bit.</description>

      <description>Lets just say, for instance, that you have an MX series router at somewhere on your network. Lets also say that said router is carved into more than just the main logical system. For the sake of this writing, lets say that your eBGP sessions are in the default logical system and your IGP is in the logical system, lets call it &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo;.
JunOS has some wonderful mechanisms for keeping things running, one is called NSR (Non Stop Routing), the other is called ISSU (In Service Software Upgrade).</description>

ISPs and NSPs have been doing it forever to allow for a very low cost, very scriptable and very effective way to wholesale block a layer3 address. However, it can seem like a bit of a black box to anyone who has never done it.
I recently did some work spinning this up in a good sized network that it didn&amp;rsquo;t currently exist, and remembered how monumentally useful (and simple) it actually is.</description>

      <description>I did some minor tweaking to the Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts and some modifications to make RANCID work under my pfsense environment (originally m0n0rancid code from John Skopis). Since I don&amp;rsquo;t really do much dev work and am not interested in maintaing a box do be an SVN server for the public, I threw it up onto google code.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding a brief how-to on making RANCID work with pfSense as soon as I get some time.</description>

      <description>I found most of this on a web page somewhere tha tI can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find again. Below are some common useful junos tidbits regarding routing tables and interface types/names:
JunOS CLI supports the basic grep command (like | include) so any show commands can be grepped. I believe the grep command implies the -i flag for case insensitivity.
The routing table is presented in such a way to group types of routes.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to upgrade a few MX480 routers and decided that it would be a good opportunity to get some experience with Juniper&amp;rsquo;s in service software upgrade.
I&amp;rsquo;d read a bit about it but I&amp;rsquo;d not had the chance to really use it. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward and it does what it claims. The following are my notes from rolling through this on my test lab MX480.
A few things are necessary to get going with ISSU, first and foremost, you need to have a box with two routing engines.</description>

      <description>At the 2010 Supercomputing conference this year, one of my tasks was to get RANCID working on the Alcatel Lucent 77xx series. for some this may have been a simple task, but for me, a self taught and inefficient programmer, it was something that took some time.
The Alcatel Lucent boxes were good performers, but their CLI is pretty awful. The prompt changes based on having unsaved configuration items, and can contain things liks an asterisk.</description>

      <description>D.C. - Sep 4, 2011
Question&amp;hellip;was this enabled on the cluster? If so are you enabling PIM/IGMP on the reth interfaces or just on the physical ones?
Thanks,
D.C. Nick Buraglio - Sep 6, 2011
It is enabled on the cluster. We have no Reth interfaces, it&amp;rsquo;s all in active/active. Chris A. - Oct 3, 2011
Thanks. I&amp;rsquo;am sure our professional services team can take this knowledge and apply it in the field.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working toward a more simplified model for our network path, and in doing so, we desired a congruent path for IPv6, IPv4 Multicast and IPv4 Unicast.
However, this is actually pretty hard when dealing with the link speeds, amounts of traffic and flows that we do, in conjunction with Firewall&amp;hellip;..and IDP/IPS&amp;hellip;
Lots of research, reading and testing was done.
Juniper SRX series has full support for 90% of this, with IPv6 IDP coming in Q2 of 2011.</description>

      <title>RADIUS and AAA on IOS</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not the greatest at AAA on Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS. I always have to think about how to order things, and to test fallback (which you should do anyway). One of the caveats that I always overlook, no matter how many times I set this up, is that Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that the security server or local username database responds by denying the user access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are attempted*.</description>
