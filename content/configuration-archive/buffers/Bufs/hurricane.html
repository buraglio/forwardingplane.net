BCM56170 is identified as Hurricane3. Perhaps BCM56160 is Hurricane2 and
BCM56150 is Hurricane1 or just Herricane. These ASICs have in common
that they have an ARM A9 processor and are intended for deployment
at the network edge -- the access layer. They have modest packet
buffer memory and very low power consumption.

As noted on the datasheets, the 56160 and 56170 are m-gig capable to 
support speeds 1, 2.5 and 5 Gb/s. Also per the datasheet, packet 
memory for the 56170 is not specified. 
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010606/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/s5860-series-switches-datasheet.pdf">datasheet for Hurricane
switches</a> from fs.com is the source for the packet memory size (**) 
So far, none of the Hurricane switches have an ONIE loader. 
OS software provided by the manufacturer is what you get.
<p>
<b>BCM56150</b> switches with 48 access ports almost certainly contain two ASICs.
