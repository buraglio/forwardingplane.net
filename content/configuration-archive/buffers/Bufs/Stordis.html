<h1>APS (Advanced Programmable Switches)</h1>
<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
<ul>On August 7th, 2020, APS Networks® was founded by Alexander Jeffries, 
Andrew Heal &amp; Joerg Peter Hahn, and started trading from October 2020. 
APS Networks® acquired the Advanced Programmable Switches (APS®) BF2556X-1T 
and BF6064X-T from its current product portfolio, including IP, staff and 
related customer base from STORDIS as part of an asset deal, forming an 
ideal starting ground for the company. The two  APS® switches were originally 
launched at the 2019 OCP Global Summit in San Diego, CA, US. APS Networks® 
now provides support to all global customers who have acquired or a planning 
to acquire the APS® switches.

Ports 1-16 now claim to run at speeds 1, 2.5. 5 and 10 Gb/s. Not clear
what this means since the ports are SFP+ and not tw-pr. No help from
the list of transceivers on their web site.
