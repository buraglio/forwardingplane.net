The EX4500 is no spring chicken, having been introduced in May 2010 as part of
Juniper's data center switching strategy.  This is a 2RU product that has 40
built in 1G/10G SFP+ ports with expansion slots to add 8 additional SFP+ ports.
Juniper says <b>nothing</b> about packet memory for this switch, but it was 
swept up in Tolly report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010652/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/tolly-IBM-G8264.PDF">211108</a>. A 2014
post about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010652/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Juniper-buffers.pdf">juniper switch buffers</a>
is in addition to Tolly's empirical number. <i>isp-tech.ru</i> says that
the switch asic is Marvell CX 8248/8234.

Announced in Fall 2012, the EX4550 is the product-line successor to the 4500.
First mention of a 4500
switch in customer hands on the j-nsp mail list is Februrary 2013 in response
to a question asked the previous month. From the discussions, it appears that
the EX4550 does not do cut-thru switching and that makes shared buffer 
utilization somewhat less effective than it might otherwise be.  
The 4550 is a 1-RU top-of-rack switch. From specs, I suspect that that
the 4550 and 4500 use the same ASIC silicon.

There are four base variants.  Front-to-back and back-to-front air flow; 10 GbaseT
and SFP+. The expansion module on the left side is also available in interface
configurations that include QSFP (not pictured).

Juniper does not talk about packet memory in the switch data sheet and here 
Tolly has not come to the rescue. According to a 2010 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010652/https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog50/presentations/Monday/NANOG50.Talk34.Scholl-Talk34.cheaper.pdf">NANOG presentation</a>, Juniper Ex-series
switches use Marvell silicon. At the time this was written, the Ex4600 had
not yet been released.
