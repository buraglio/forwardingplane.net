[RFC 9872](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9872/) makes recommendations for NAT64 prefix discovery for hosts supporting v4-to-v6 translation. Co-host Nick Buralgio is a co-author of this RFC, so we’re taking the opportunity to talk about it in detail. We discuss the problems RFC 9872 is addressing and why a new RFC was needed for operational guidance, not necessarily defining a protocol or standard. We learn the effects of this RFC on previous RFCs, specifically [7050](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7050) and [8781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8781). Lastly, we share the implications of RFC 9872 on listeners and recommend they do a little labbing to see what this really means for the networks they manage.
