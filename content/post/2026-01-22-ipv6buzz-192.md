Thinking of setting up an IPv6 lab this year? Our hosts dive into a major update on building and testing modern IPv6 networks, focusing on the game-changing “IPv6-mostly” architecture. They break down the essential components you need to get this working, including DHCP Option 108 and the nitty gritty of client support.

In this episode, Tom incorrectly identifies Debian 13 as the platform he got IPv6-mostly working on when in reality it was CentOS 9 Stream. In his defense, Tom had been fixated all week on how cool he thinks Debian is generally (Debian, sadly, doesn’t feel the same way about him) and his old-man brain didn’t catch the error in real time (even after bringing up the EPEL repo). He sincerely regrets and is low-key mortified about the error but doesn’t want any listeners to labor under the misconception that CentOS is a no-go with IPv6-mostly.
