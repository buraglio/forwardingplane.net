<h2>HPE Altoline 6921 family</h2>
<table width="700">
<tr><td>
<b>Introduced: Sept 2016</b>
<p>
A family of switches with front-to-back and back-to-front airflow and
your choice of Tw-Pr 10 Gb/s or SFP+ access ports.
<p>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010607/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/HPE-6921-specs.pdf">data sheet</a> says that this switch
has 12 MB of packet buffer and was introduced in 2016. There is an
inconsistency here. The Trident-II had 12 MB of buffer but started 
shipping in 2014. The Trident-II+ has 16 MB of buffer and started shipping
in 2016.
<p>
Moving right along, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010607/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/HPE-6921-specs.pdf"> data sheet</a>
 says that the switch has VXLAN L2 and
L3. That is hard way of claiming the <b>RIOT</b> capability. That stands
for <b>R</b>outing <b>I</b>n and <b>O</b>ut of <b>T</b>unnels. Trident-II+
had that feature but Trident-II did not.
<p>
My conclusion is that this <b>is</b> a Trident-II+ switch with 16 MB
of buffer, claims in the data sheet of 12 MB not withstanding. This switch is
made for HPE by Accton. Their model numbers are AS5812-54X AS5812-54T. And
they got the buffer cache size right.
