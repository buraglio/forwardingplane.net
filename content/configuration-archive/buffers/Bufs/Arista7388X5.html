Two types of plugin cards are available
<li>8 port DCS-7388-8D QSFP-DD 400G w MACSEC
<li>16 port DCS-7388-16CD QSFP28/QSFP56
<p>
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010708/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7388X5-Datasheet.pdf">data sheet at release</a> mis-identifies
the card type in the picture above and on page 2 of the datasheet. There are
two SFP+ ports on the management card. These ports are connected directly to
the CPU and do not touch the ASIC.
<p>
Note that there is no card type with OSPF. Evidence of death of
the part?
