<p>
The EX4500 is no spring chicken, having been introduced in May 2010 as part of
Juniper's data center switching strategy.  This is a 2RU product that has 40
built in 1G/10G SFP+ ports with expansion slots to add 8 additional SFP+ ports.
Juniper says <b>nothing</b> about packet memory for this switch, but it was 
swept up in Tolly report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010652/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/tolly-IBM-G8264.PDF">211108</a>. A 2014
post about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010652/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Juniper-buffers.pdf">juniper switch buffers</a>
is in addition to Tolly's empirical number. <i>isp-tech.ru</i> says that
the switch asic is Marvell CX 8248/8234.

<p>
Announced in Fall 2012, the EX4550 is the product-line successor to the 4500.
First mention of a 4500
switch in customer hands on the j-nsp mail list is Februrary 2013 in response
to a question asked the previous month. From the discussions, it appears that
the EX4550 does not do cut-thru switching and that makes shared buffer 
utilization somewhat less effective than it might otherwise be.  
The 4550 is a 1-RU top-of-rack switch. From specs, I suspect that that
the 4550 and 4500 use the same ASIC silicon. 
<p>
There are four base variants.  Front-to-back and back-to-front air flow; 10 GbaseT
and SFP+. The expansion module on the left side is also available in interface
configurations that include QSFP (not pictured).
<p>
Juniper does not talk about packet memory in the switch data sheet and here 
Tolly has not come to the rescue. According to a 2010 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010652/https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog50/presentations/Monday/NANOG50.Talk34.Scholl-Talk34.cheaper.pdf">NANOG presentation</a>, Juniper Ex-series
switches use Marvell silicon. At the time this was written, the Ex4600 had
not yet been released.
