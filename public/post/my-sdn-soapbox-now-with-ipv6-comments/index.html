Totally agree. Work smarter not harder, it&rsquo;s a good idea and it makes sense. Is it different? Yup. Is it better? Maybe not now, but eventually it will be. Look at the state of routing hardware in 1995. Now look at it. It was a totally different experience and it was not even a real shift in thinking. 10 years from now we will be saying &ldquo;remember when we had to touch every device&rdquo; just like we did with wireless APs not 7-8 years ago."/>

<p>Totally agree. Work smarter not harder, it&rsquo;s a good idea and it makes sense. Is it different? Yup. Is it better? Maybe not now, but eventually it will be. Look at the state of routing hardware in 1995. Now look at it. It was a totally different experience and it was not even a real shift in thinking. 10 years from now we will be saying &ldquo;remember when we had to touch every device&rdquo; just like we did with wireless APs not 7-8 years ago.

<p>Totally agree with everything your saying. Too many people are getting comfortable in their field. I got into the field because I am a huge supporter of continual learning. Like Brent mentioned, we WILL be moving at the speed of software. There is no question about that. The networking field is in dire need of a reboot. The speed of hardware innovation has allowed people to get to comfortable with a particular technology. If your worried about being replaced by software, you probably will be. Survival of the fittest.

<p>Thanks Nick! You bring up a good point. What do you have to lose in just being open minded. I guess one could say we are being closed minded by not thinking that we can efficiently scale networks for the rest of our careers doing it how we have always done it. Not sure I want to be the guy evangelizing mainframes in 1995 though. Innovating at the speed of software rather than hardware is much more attractive. Managing state is horrid today. We both are responsible for huge networks. We had a huge power outage the other day. So after power came back and the network converged, it was the normal thing. Hmm, I wonder if everything is working? Well ICMP says yes&hellip; but you only have two options. A) Call every tenant to see if people that have nothing do do with IT see anything wrong (e.g. nurses, admin assistants, researchers) or (B. Wait until someone calls and tells you something still isn&rsquo;t working&hellip; Both suck, one doesn&rsquo;t scale and both are bad service. Btw, that goth chick picture is classic. Thats how I feel when I used to hit the enter button on a major change. Modeling and debugging networks programmatically some day will be win. Great post, -Brent

<p>I agree with Brent&hellip; The complexity of networks is getting to the point where they are extremely difficult to manage. Some of the WAN networks I work on are moving to a virtualized model with VRFs and DMVPN tunnels. This model provides a lot of cool functionality, especially with respect to partitioning and securing traffic. However, the router configuration is getting so complicated it seems that fewer and fewer engineers understand what&rsquo;s going on. There are too many opportunities for mistakes. We have to get out of the mindset of implementing complex traffic management schemes by configuring one router at a time. There has got to be a better way to manage traffic on the network.

<p>Wow! A comment by the Z man! The original Starlight Engineer! I&rsquo;m in 100% agreement Paul, &ldquo;We have to get out of the mindset of implementing complex traffic management schemes by configuring one router at a time. There has got to be a better way to manage traffic on the network.&rdquo; is an amazingly accurate statement.

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like talking about &lsquo;have to do [something]&rsquo;. My mindset is that all these new developments are extremely interesting and exciting. And I want to learn everything about them. :-)
