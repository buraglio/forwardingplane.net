Introduced: 31 January 2017

There is also an all-QSFP model of this switch not shown here but described
in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010753/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/qfx5110.pdf"> data sheet.</a>

<h3>What Juniper says about buffering</h3>
<p>
<ul>
Intelligent Buffer Management—The QFX5110 switches
have a total of 16 MB shared buffers. While 25% of the total
buffer space is dedicated, the rest is shared among all ports
and is user configurable. The intelligent buffer mechanism
in the QFX5110 effectively absorbs traffic bursts while
providing deterministic performance, significantly increasing
performance over static allocation.
</ul>
This is similar to what Juniper said about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010753/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Juniper-5100">
QFX5100</a> three years ago. Consistency is good.
