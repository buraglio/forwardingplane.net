      <description>Over the last few days there has been a huge amount of FUD and panic surrounding two as-yet-to-be-published CVEs (found here and here) related to Mikrotik&amp;rsquo;s IPv6 implementation.It is my opinion that this entire process has been poorly handled, and that the community involved tends to be fairly sensitive to issues such as, and the cloak and dagger nature of the two issues has only exacerbated it. Mikrotik, as a company, is well known for being terse in their responses and tight lipped with their internal workings and dealings with these kinds of issues.</description>

      <description>As a follow on to my post on why small to medium ISPs should deploy IPv6 and the associated APNIC blog post, I have begun to compile a list of commonly asked questions IPv6 and their answers in relation to how a small to medium sized ISP can (and should) deploy IPv6. Expect this list to change and grow over time. -&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;
Q: Is there DHCP in IPv6?

      <description>IPv6 has been a crusade of mine for well over a decade. Wether it is teaching IPv6 workshops, offering advice to new users, answering questions, or evangelizing it ad nauseam, it is an important topic to me. The ISP world holds a special place in my heart since a good deal of my early experience came from building or assisting regional ISPs. Recently I had a fun opportunity to talk about deploying IPv6 on The Brothers WISP podcast.</description>

      <description>As a follow up to my last post, I wanted to dive a little deeper into the world of address translation and to suss out some of the more compelling details.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve said on many occasions, it pains me to see NAT referenced as a security mechanism. That said, where PNAT can be beneficial is in an overall privacy strategy, however, even that is comparatively low value and given the current state of global IPv4 allocations, arguably a detriment to usability - we’ll get to that - before we do, it is important to understand what ’NAT” as we call it today actually is, and to do that we need to explain all of the types of address translation (yes, there are several).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that RF technologies and what like to call &amp;ldquo;specialty networking&amp;rdquo; are two of my favorite things in the networking space. Put them together and it is like chocolate and peanut butter! Now, some may not consider Field Area Networking (FAN) to be &amp;ldquo;unconventional&amp;rdquo;, but it certainly falls well outside of the space of what is typically traditional enterprise networking. That said, Cisco&amp;rsquo;s FAN briefing at Network Field Day 17 really got me excited and thinking about the alternatives for the IoT space.</description>

      <description>I admit that the title was meant to be inflammatory. However, there are use cases that aren&amp;rsquo;t terribly uncommon where an in-line security appliance is just not the correct tool for the job. Someone once told me &amp;ldquo;a firewall protects a network like a fuse protects an electrical circuit&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a correct statement. Firewall vendors will probably argue this and enterprise folks may discount this as heresy and call for burning me at the stake.</description>

      <title>Aging hardware, IPv6 and the growing route table</title>
      <link>https://forwardingplane.net/2014/08/aging-hardware-ipv6-and-the-growing-route-table/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve blathered on about BGP forever. Say what you will about the venerable protocol, it runs the interwebs, is reliable, extendable and well documented. I&amp;rsquo;ve also espoused&amp;rdquo;) ad nauseam about IPv6, so none of this [admitted] rant should really be a surprise coming from me. As of 8/12/2014, according to the CIRD report (and many mailing lists), the default free global ipv4 routing table has reached 512k routes. This is a milestone from many perspectives, but more importantly, it solidifies the fact that there is a great deal of equipment in critical points in the internet that is out of date and cannot perform as intended in its current configuration or function.</description>

      <description>IP addressing and subnetting is a common interview subject. I assert that memorizing these things is useful for learning the concepts but ultimately futile in that it is time consuming and inefficient use of engineering time when tools can be utilized to accomplish the same goals in less time with fewer errors. Honestly, I gave up doing this kind of work manually around 10 years ago and have never regretted it, and in actuality, I&amp;rsquo;d probably struggle to do it at this point because it&amp;rsquo;s a repetitive process better suited by code.</description>

      <description>I am an absolutely huge fan of statistical and instrumentation data, especially when it comes to traffic analysis, visualization and baselining. I&amp;rsquo;ve rambled on about the importance of it at every opportunity. As a result of that, I have been doing work with netflow and netflow-like data for a fairly long time. My first collector was the OSU Flow tools based stuff back around 13 years ago. From there I played with all kinds of netflow tools, both commercial and open source, finally settling most of my focus on nfdump and nfsen.</description>

      <title>Sonicwall revisited - Now with IPv6 - and way too much licensing cruft.</title>

      <description>About a year ago I did a brief review of the &amp;ldquo;new Sonicwall&amp;rdquo;, specifically a smaller branch office device that was said should have had all of the features of the larger devices. I proposed that it had some significant limitations (much to the disagreement of a great deal of folks). However, I stand by my statements. If you ignore the fact that firewalls often cause more problems than they solve, that NAT is a nightmarish kludge (and not a security mechanism), and will likely be phased out for better options eventually, the SonicOS I tested was pretty limited as far as what I believe should be features.</description>

      <description>I have been learning and using IPv6 for a quite a while, even before I worked in research and education, back in the ISP days. I thought I should learn it because, frankly, I figured we&amp;rsquo;d all be converted to it by now, already whole hog using it like it was the layer 3 addressing mechanism that it is. Flashback: My first IPv6 access was via a tunnel to HE a long, long time ago and before that I was reading what I could about it.</description>

      <title>IPv6 Feature Matrix (Again)</title>

      <description>There has been some recent chatter on the IPv6 Ops mailing list about the feature matrix. Sadly, I&amp;rsquo;ve let this sort of wither on the vine for a while in favor of OpenFlow and SDN. At the end of the day, though, as a whole we actually need IPv6 more than SDN and OpenFlow at this moment in time, so I&amp;rsquo;m resurrecting it. It is available here. A few additions have been made and there is now a &amp;ldquo;last edited&amp;rdquo; cell so folks can tell if the data is stale or not.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the fact that there seems to be a lack of options in a very specific product level. Lets say you have a network that looks like this: Right Away you&amp;rsquo;re limited since you need MPLS and more than 2 10G interfaces. Even more so if you require full support for IPv6 and ISIS. If budget is of any concern, you&amp;rsquo;re in real trouble. For many, Cisco pricing and smartnet is potentially going to exclude anything reasonable from them.</description>

      <description>This week there was a lot of buzz about SDN (as usual). There was alightreading thread that I commented on and a fantastic read by Brent Salisbury about being the steamroller and not the road that got me thinking about OpenFlow and SDN in a way I had not before.   All that is old is new again. I remember when internal networks were small and routing protocols were taboo in many internal environments.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently run into a situation where there was no longer enough space in the FIB to handle both the full IPv4 global table and the full IPv6 global table. We prefer to run a default-free network within this particular SP network, but in this case, until a hardware refresh can happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to adjust that. Given what we knew about the size of both tables, it made more sense to take a default IPv6 route from one transit provider and filter the rest.</description>

      <description>Recently SI6 released the IPv6 Toolkit 1.3  This release is on the heels of this IETF draft  on IPv6 host scanning. It was long thought that scanning an IPv6 network was impossible. The address space was too large and reliably ascertaining the hosts from it would be too time consuming to even attempt. However, as Dr. Hans Zarkov says in the 1980 classic cult film of my youth, Flash Gordon, &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t beat the human spirit!</description>

      <description>I have a bunch of Apple wireless gear at my house. It&amp;rsquo;s inexpensive, feature rich and easy to maintain. However, with the update to mountain lion a while ago, the ability to install the older Airport Utility stopped. This is annoying since I have what apple now considers &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; features like IPv6 at my home and essentially all my gear here is a lab (except for the plex server =) I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on cacti lately, and I wanted to test out the syslog plugin&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>IPv6 is coming. Like SDN, we can&amp;rsquo;t ignore it. Are you ready? Are you apps ready? I&amp;rsquo;ll wager the answer is no. Mine aren&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on IPv6 for about 11 years, from early days of tunnels to full native IPv6 at home and at work. In teaching the IPv6 workshop for internet2, one of the things that I always suggest is to have a dual stacked host and an IPv6 only host available for testing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of IPv6 privacy addressing. I understand the logic behind it, I really doo, obfuscate the LLADDR (MAC address) of the host in question, but I really dont&amp;rsquo;t see the realistic purpose. If someone wanted to use my mac address, what good would that really get them, unless they&amp;rsquo;re on the same layer 2 segment? More importantly, if they;re on the same layer 2 segment, they have my MAC address anyway.</description>

      <description>It looks like MacOS 10.7 (Lion) has fully functioning DHCPv6. It&amp;rsquo;s about time.
Before:

After:

pfSense setup:

Using Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server 4.2.1-P1 as the server (on my pfSense box) I am able to get not only a privacy address (via stateless autoconfigure) but also a normal EUI-64 address as well as an IPv6 address via dhcpv6.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything except use the &amp;ldquo;Automatic&amp;rdquo; setting in the network control panel, so out of the box OSX 10.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of IPv6 stuff lately, and one of the things I didn&amp;rsquo;t find (and kinda just wanted to put one together for my own benefit) is a matrix of features I thought were important to have on the IPv6 side for common network hardware. Below is a work in progress of what I have so far, which will automatically publish changes from this spreadsheet. Please email me if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in adding to this or correcting anything I may be incorrect on.</description>

      <description>After enabling the IPv6 Flow based processing, we decided to get rolling with making our IPv6 path congruent with everything else (IPv4 unicast and multicast). With all of the other things we had going on, we thought this would be a low hanging fruit that would be easily plucked from the routing tree. Well, a minor oversight on our part caught us by surprise.
According to this handy dandy matrix for JunOS 10.</description>

      <title>SRX IPv6 flow based processing</title>

      <description>One of our plans is to consolidate as many of the egress trafic paths as possible. To facilitate this, we had to do some things like buy carrier grade equipment. Enter the SRX 5800. No one really does IPS/IDP+Firewall quite like the SRX. After extensive research and exhaustive hands on testing with quite a bit of equipment, that is what we settled on. Even the IBM &amp;ldquo;technical evangelist&amp;rdquo; guy that came to talk to us said &amp;ldquo;No one really does it like they do&amp;rdquo; when referring to Juniper and 10G firewall/IPS.</description>

      <title>Viewing ipv6 router advertisements</title>

      <description>I knew a tool like this had to exist, but I had never needed to look in the past. While debugging a RA problem, I come upon the need to view IPv6 router advertisements. How can one do this? tcpdump? Yeah, I guess that could work. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like using a bulldozer when a wheelbarrow is all you need, though. I could use ndpmon, I suppose, but that, too seems like overkill.</description>
