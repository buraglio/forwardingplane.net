<b>Announced 14 June 2017</b>
<p>
We have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/trident3.pdf">press release.</a>
<p>
There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Trident3-flyer.pdf">information sheet</a> [june 2017]
<p>
Broadcom says that the Trident3 has a unified buffer, unlike
the segmented buffer of the Tomahawk. X7, X5 and X4 have <b>32 Mbyte packet buffer.</b>
X3 has 8 Mbyte of packet buffer.
The silicon geometry
is 16 nm, same as the Trident2+. Best info so far is a PacketPushers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/packet-pushers-trident-3.pdf">blog posting</a>. But you 
should read the post on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/http://packetpushers.net/broadcom-trident3-programmable-varied-volume/">blog site</a> 
to enjoy the fine discussion that follows.

<p>
Sometime after the information sheet, it became clear that there are
two versions of the X4 varient:
<p>
<li> BCM56770   48 10G ports + 8 100G QSFP ports
<li> BCM56771   48 10G ports + 6 100G QSFP ports
<p>
Arista has an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/7050X3_Architecture_WP.pdf">architecture paper</a>
[March 29, 2018]
with useful detail about Trident-3 that has not been released by
Broadcom. Compare with figure 5 in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Arista_7050X_Switch_Architecture.pdf">Trident2 architecture</a> paper. <i>Internals</i> block diagram of the Trident-3:

<p>
A point made by Tofino and the P4 proponents is that having identical pipeline stages makes it easier to reuse 
the chip for new protocols.
<p>
The Trident3 has been designed with Broadview fine grained 
performance monitoring in mind, so
there's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Trident3-telemetry.pdf"> information
sheet</a> on that. A sample look at a microburst as seen by
the Trident3:

<h2>Independent Software</h2>
<p>
Packet Pushers blog reviewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010719/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/.&#32;arrcus.pdf">independent software</a>
tooled up for the Trident-3.
<p>
<h2>Testing update</h2>
<p>
Tristan Suerink has tested Trident3 and found that its throughput claims are exagerated.
