OpenFlow statistics from my home installation powered by a 48 port, PoE [Allied Telesis x930](https://www.alliedtelesis.com/products/switches/x930-series) and a minimal linux container running [Faucet](https://www.faucet.nz/). This installation runs my home, my home office, and my rack of lab gear.
