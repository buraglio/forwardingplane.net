As an often-security-engineer and an individual that has been working on large networks for quite a while, dealing with DDoS, or the threat of DDoS is a well traveled path. Recently I was invited to discuss some of the basics of DDoS mitigation on the Network Collective Podcast. This was a really fun and insightful chat with a wealth of great information for engineers and operators of any skill level.   [Ep38 - DDoS Mitigation](https://vimeo.com/298146825) from [Network Collective](https://vimeo.com/networkcollective) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).   As mentioned in the cast, there are some good, free resources out there for black hole routing.
