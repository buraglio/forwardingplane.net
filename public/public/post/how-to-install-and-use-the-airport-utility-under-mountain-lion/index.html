                <p>I have a bunch of Apple wireless gear  at my house.  It&rsquo;s inexpensive, feature rich and easy to maintain.  However, with the update to mountain lion a while ago, the ability to install  the older Airport Utility stopped.  This is annoying since I have what apple now considers &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; features like IPv6 at my home and essentially all my gear here is a lab (except for the plex server =) I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on <a href="http://www.cacti.net">cacti</a> lately, and I wanted to test out the syslog plugin&hellip;.ok, easy.  It&rsquo;s all set up.  Then I got to thinking &ldquo;why not just let this run and syslog all my gear like the good &lsquo;ol days?&rdquo;  Nerdy?  Yes, but hey, I collect flow data at home and have a <a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/homenet/">weathermap</a> of my home network.  It keeps me eating my own dog food with the netflow exporter plugin on <a href="http://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a> and it&rsquo;s fun. Uh, oh.  No ability to set syslog receiver on the airport gear anymore.  Not cool.  [Guess what, no way to change IPv6 settings anymore either] No way to do a standard install of the old utility. Lame, Apple, Lame.  After poking around a bit I found a pretty easy way to do it as long as you&rsquo;re not afraid of the command line. Since at least a few other folks will want to do this, here it is: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1536">Download the App</a> from Apple. Mount the Downloaded disk. Open Terminal. Type:<code>
pkgutil --expand /Volumes/AirPortUtility/AirPortUtility56.pkg
cd ~/Desktop/AirPortTemp~/Desktop/AirPortTemp/AirPortUtility56Lion.pkg/
open Payload
cd &quot;Payload 2 2/Applications/Utilities/&quot;
open .
</code><a href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-11.32.08-PM.png"><img src="http://www.forwardingplane.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-11.32.08-PM.png" alt="" title="Screen Shot 2013-01-08 at 11.32.08 PM" /></a> Done.  That should open a finder window with the App in it.  You can copy it to you /Applications/Utilities folder and use it alongside the newer one.  You&rsquo;ll need to authenticate to copy into the /Applications/Utilities directory. Edits made and Poof!  Now I can see my syslogs from within cacti.</p>
