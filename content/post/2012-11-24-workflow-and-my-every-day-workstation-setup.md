Recently, there was a [thread over at Packet Pushers](http://forum.packetpushers.net/showthread.php/309-Productivity-or-Social-Apps?p=1276) about what folks use for their daily workflow.  I quickly realized that my setup is pretty simple (as I like it) and relied on a large amount of terminal based tools, which makes sense since I have been a UNIX (or UNIX based) OS user since my migration from the original MacOS back in the 1990s.  Anyway, Since I wrote most of this up already, I thought I'd post it here:**
