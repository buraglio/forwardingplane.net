I was very excited for this episode. James Harr, a fellow engineer from the research and education community came up with a great project called the IPv6-Pod, which was initially funded by ARIN. It aims to provide a simple way to test software and services to see if they work in a variety of IPv6 environments, including v6-only, dual-stack, and others? This project provides a device, at no cost to the applicant, that comes with a variety of v6 test networks. Itâ€™s aimed at developers, network engineers, and IT support teams. 

On this IPv6 Buzz James talks about how the device works and how to experiment with it in different environments. He also discusses how he secured funding, the current state of the project, and how others can get involved.

Sadly, I had a last minute conflict and could not make the recording, but I did listen, and it's great. Check it out!
