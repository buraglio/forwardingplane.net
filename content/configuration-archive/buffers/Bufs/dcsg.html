<h2>Disaggregated Cell Site Gateways</h2>

Including these switches on the buffer page is perhaps a
stretch. These gateways are used in LTE and 5G networks. Because
they are made with the same ASICs as <i>regular</i> network switches,
there is no reason [except software and perhaps cost] that they
couldn't be used as regular switches.
<p>
One thing that sets them appart from other devices is that they
contain GPS receivers that permit them to act as timing
grand masters to help spread clock information. <b>IEEE 1588</b>
precision timing protocol is well described in Wikipedia articles.
What is not clear to me is whether the requirement to run neighboring
cell sites off a common clock has anything to do with the large 
buffering that these switches offer.

Edge-core has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010626/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/DCSG.pdf">short presentation</a> 
that describes their three gateways.  One of the switches has been

The extra parts that are required for the satellite time receiver
are apparent in the block diagram.
<p>
It is common for DCSG switches to be rated for use in remote cellsite
cabinets by having an extended temperature rating.
