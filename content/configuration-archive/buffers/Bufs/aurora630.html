There is a nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010722/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/aurora-630.pdf">datasheet</a>. That three rows of SFP
connectors will fit into a 1 RU panel seems extraordinary. Hence the work here to
show the detail in a line diagram. Perhaps only 32 SFP28 connections will be needed
and the center row can be left empty. If more ports will be needed cable routing
will require care.

The switch ASIC is a Tomahawk BCM56960. It has 128 SERDES not all of which are used
in this switch.
