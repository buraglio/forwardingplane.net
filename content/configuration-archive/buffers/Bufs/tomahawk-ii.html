<h2>Tomahawk-ii</h2>

All we have at this writing [November 1, 2016] is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010619/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/tomahawk-ii.pdf">press release.</a> As noted, this announcement 
comes 2 years after the tomahawk press release. Two years, 2X the ports, 
2X switching bandwidth.

<p>
We are told that there is more stuff [buffers, forwarding tables]. We get to wait to find out how much more.
<p>
Here's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010619/https://networkingnerd.net/tag/tomahawk-ii/">more substantial review.</a> And here's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010619/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/rule11.pdf">another one</a>.
<p>
OEMs that know the most about Broadcom ASICs and are willing to 
offer details are Cisco and Arista. Cisco has a graphic from 2018
that shows both the total buffer [42 MB] and that the four-slice
segmented architecture from Tomahawk has be retained.
