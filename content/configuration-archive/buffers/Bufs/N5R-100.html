This is an annotated trade-show beauty shot of the PARPRO N5R-100 switch. Heat sinks were
removed from the big ICs to show off the design. Pictures on the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010743/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/N5R-100_ds_v201.pdf"> data sheet</a> show the
heat sinks.

PARPRO is an ODM (original device manufacturer). While there is a generic model number,
there are no catalog parts to purchase and there are no distributors. Everything is custom.
This is a <i>white box switch</i>. What that means is the hardware is sold with libraries
that can connect linux running on the intel system processor to the hardware. But the
<i>application</i> that talks to the library is provided by the customer. 
<p>
PARPRO was showing their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010743/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/EZchip.html"> EZChip design</a> in the trade show booth because it was EZChip's 
booth. As an ODM, PARPRO can make lots of things including Trident2 switches. But
not here, and not today.
<p>
<b>Max buffer</b>
<p>
Without specifying the application software, there is no way to say what the restrictions on single queue
buffer length are. Clearly, there is a lot of packet memory here. Probably there is so much memory that
you might get into trouble from over abundance. Listing the NP-5 as a virtual output port queuing system
is based on the data sheet. And the NP-5 can be used in a Pizzabox mode as well as a line card and
crossbar switch mode. The VoQ description might apply better to the latter than to the former.
