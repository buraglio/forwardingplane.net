Included in this collection because UCSC owns lots of these.  
The 6610-24 has one packet processor with 4 MB of buffers. 
Each packet processor has 4 cores, each with 1 MB of buffers. 
Each core serves six Gig-E ports and two 10 Gb/s ports. 
There is a 48-port version of this switch that has two packet 
processors which doubles the total buffer memory.

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603/http://www.brocadechina.com/download/icx6610/FCX_ICX_6610_07300_DebugGuide.pdf">debug guide</a> for the 6610 has chip level debug commands
for the Prestera switch. Marvell makes a SoC switch with that name, so 
this tells us a lot about the engine Brocade is using.

Brocade has a nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010603/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/Brocade_ICX6610_architecture.pdf">architectural review</a>.  The paper does not explain how multicast packets are processed.
