<h2>Nexus ACI</h2>
<p>
<b>Application Centric Infrastructure</b> [ACI] has
been described as Cisco's answer to SDN. At its core, it 
applies security labels to encapsulate packets. Encapsulation
done in 2014 required custom silicon and was outside the
reach of merchant silicon of the day. It may be possible to
do ACI with today's programmable pipeline ASICs -- or maybe
not.
<p>
The 9300 models appear to be the oldest of the fleet (2014).
They are a hybrid design with Broadcom Trident2 forwarding
engines and a custom Cisco ALE [Application Leaf Engine] chip to fix the warts.
That the hybrid products have been discontinued and Cisco now uses
<i>full custom</i> suggests that the original products were a stand
in for an ASIC that had fallen behind in development.
<p>
In <b>2016</b> Cisco introduced Nexus 9200 ACI switches. <i>ACI</i>
stands for <i>ACI Spine Engine</i>. The ACI ASICs work stand-alone --
without a Trident-2 forwarding engine.
<p>
In <b>March 2016</b> Cisco added the LSE [Leaf Spine Engine] which is
touted as the first 16 nM geometry switch engine. It 
has a two-slice design with 40 MBytes split two ways. The LSE has
<i>Elephant trap</i> auto prioritization which will keep large
flows from trashing the performance of small flows.
<p>
In <b>March 2017</b> Cisco added the <b>FX</b> version of this
ASIC.
<p>
In <b>December 2017</b> Cisco announced the <b>FX2</b> which
provides netflow collection and export.
<p>
In <b>October 2018</b> Cisco announced the <b>GX</b> which has
80 MB of buffer split across four slices.
It is described in BRKDCN-3222.
<p>
In <b>June 2020</b> Cisco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260106010731/https://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/Bufs/GX2-blog.pdf">announced</a> the 
<b>GX2</b> with 100 MB of buffer. There are two ASIC varients: 
<b>GX2B</b> with 2 slice-pairs
and <b>GX2A</b> with 4 slice-pairs.
Exactly what makes <i>slice-pair</i> is not clear.
Perhaps there are separate slices for <i>input</i> and <i>output</i>.
The ASIC has 7 nm fabrication technology and is built out of
chiplets rather than an integrated single die.
