      <description>Flow data is a critical piece of understanding how your network works what what it is actively doing. It also provides a great baseline and capacity planning tool. However, some of the more feature rich NetFlow and/or sFlow collectors can be quite daunting in their cost and/or complexity to install. ElastiFlow is a great alternative for flow analytics and is built on the well traveled and robust ElasticStack, meaning, its back end is well documented, well supported, and scales exceptionally well.</description>

      <title>Basic automation for WISPs and small to medium ISPs</title>

      <description>Small to medium ISPs are an interesting phenomenon. Early in my career I was pretty heavily involved in that space, so much of my current thought processes and methodologies are heavily informed by that experience. Something that never ceases to amaze me today is that the practice of scripting and “automating” things seems to have become somewhat of a lost art, or at the very least it is not part of an initial deployment plan.</description>

      <title>Building a dynamic security infrastructure [in a box - with SDN]</title>

      <guid>https://forwardingplane.net/2019/05/building-a-dynamic-security-infrastructure-in-a-box-with-sdn/</guid>
      <description>Years ago I wrote about building a secure network in a box. Over a weekend I decided to revisit this concept thanks to a colleague at work wanting to do something similar. It got me thinking “a lot has changed since I last did this” and it felt like time to revisit it. Well, disappointment wasn’t in the cards because it’s easier, smarter, and more flexible now that it was back then.</description>

      <description>A few months ago Kevin Myers of IP Architechs introduced me to a really interesting project called FreeRouter. Being that I absolutely love alternative routing platforms and feature complete simulation environments, this really got me going. I tend to define &amp;ldquo;feature complete&amp;rdquo; in a routing platform as something that can do both IS-IS and MPLS. Given that there aren&amp;rsquo;t many platforms that do both correctly or within a reasonable budget, and offer simulation options, I was pretty excited.</description>

      <description>I recently had a need to test OpenFlow on the brocade ICX 7450 for a fairly good sized, high visibility project. The basic goal is pretty simple, Layer2 path provisioning. Straightforward and fairly well supported in OpenFlow, even from the early days. To do this, the idea was to use a turnkey platform, that way there is one throat to choke if there are issues. I landed on the Brocade Vyatta controller (which is essentially ODL), and the ICX.</description>

      <description>BigSwitch is making waves again, this time with its Big Cloud Fabric product update. I was lucky enough to get a bit of a preview of what was coming and was pleasantly surprised by the new features, finding them functionally useful for both operators, security folks and management alike.
Not only is the fabric fit to operate at hyper scale proportions, they&amp;rsquo;ve paid close attention to making such operations even easier.</description>

      <description>VMWare is a powerful tool, and monitoring is a critical service. How does one monitor such an integral piece of infrastructure, and what do they monitor it with? There are powerful commercial ways of monitoring VMware, however, for those with existing SNMP based systems in place, specifically cacti, there are options. To that end, I&amp;rsquo;ll set aside my strong distaste for SNMP [yet again], because those are for a larger, less useful series of posts.</description>

      <description>I was recently granted access to the beta BigSwitch Networks lab site, a purpose built classroom in the cloud focused on teaching the BigSwitch SDN environment. I had seen some of the BSN offerings in the past and always held them in high regard, but I was thoroughly impressed with both the completeness of the lab and how polished the controller environment was.At the time of this writing, the lab consists of 3 modules: Building cloud fabric, monitoring fabric and dynamic provisioning of monitoring fabric.</description>

      <description>I am an absolutely huge fan of statistical and instrumentation data, especially when it comes to traffic analysis, visualization and baselining. I&amp;rsquo;ve rambled on about the importance of it at every opportunity. As a result of that, I have been doing work with netflow and netflow-like data for a fairly long time. My first collector was the OSU Flow tools based stuff back around 13 years ago. From there I played with all kinds of netflow tools, both commercial and open source, finally settling most of my focus on nfdump and nfsen.</description>

      <description>In many environments, the move to virtualization is a path well traveled. My home and lab networks are no exception to this and I&amp;rsquo;m sure nearly everyone who reads these pages has at least been exposed to it in one way or another. I have played with nearly all of the virtualization platforms and am firmly in the camp that there will be a large segment of networking that will move to a virtualized platform especially in the data center and campus segments.</description>

      <description>I love to be the &amp;ldquo;uncola&amp;rdquo; of networking sites. I like interop and I don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot with Cisco because I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to much of their gear anymore. So, that being the case, I had a need to bring up a l2circuit (in JunOS speak), or VLL (in Brocade speak) between an MX480 and an MLX. Since they are very different platforms, I had to do some digging and playing around to get it to work.</description>

      <description>Jon Langemak has a great write up on building the OpenDaylight controller under CentOS. Since I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do this a bunch of times, I though tI&amp;rsquo;d take what he so generously put online and build a very rudimentary script for deploying ODC under CentOS. The prerequisites are that you already have an account and ssh key at the OpenDaylight GIT repo and that you disable SELinux. Here is the script:``` #!</description>

That said, one of the things I really like about KVM is the ability to easily view the console of a guest system using free, non-windows software like VNC. However, much like everything in life, there are reasons to do one thing or another.</description>

      <description>I had been working, off and on, on a how-to for building the daylight openflow controller under CentOS. Most openflow docs and dev are done under ubuntu or debian, and while those are both fantastic alternatives, there are a huge number of folks that will want or need to use RHEL or CentOS. So, seeing as that is the case, having someone be mindful of that is important. When I saw the write up by Jon Langemak, I scrapped my attempt at a how-to since his was so much better.</description>

      <description>I started working on Juniper equipment around 2002. At my employer, we had an M40 with the serial number 256. We did Layer3 only. I had no idea if the Juniper even did layer2. It certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a layer3 switch like a 6500 like I was used to. It was like a deliciously robust version of any Layer 3 router I&amp;rsquo;d worked on previously. Over the years Juniper has added a switching line utilizing their FreeBSD based OS, JunOS.</description>

      <description>I am a network engineer by profession, but with the proliferation of SDN and OpenFlow, I have had to spend a lot of time re-learning a lot of system admin skills that I&amp;rsquo;d shelved years ago. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a virtualization user forever. From VMware (Fusion, ESX), VirtualBox, to Parallels, I&amp;rsquo;ve used them at least in testing if not in production environments. I&amp;rsquo;d not really spent any mentionable amount of time with XEN, qEMU or KVM, but some projects I was working on suggested it for the virtualization mechanism, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try to pick it up.</description>

      <description>Recently SI6 released the IPv6 Toolkit 1.3  This release is on the heels of this IETF draft  on IPv6 host scanning. It was long thought that scanning an IPv6 network was impossible. The address space was too large and reliably ascertaining the hosts from it would be too time consuming to even attempt. However, as Dr. Hans Zarkov says in the 1980 classic cult film of my youth, Flash Gordon, &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t beat the human spirit!</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m always a fan of the little guy trying to change the world and this falls under that category. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, Arista Networks is a &amp;ldquo;hardware&amp;rdquo; networking company that is using merchant silicon wrapped in their custom linux based operating system (which is very much like IOS).</description>

Tks - nice short article that just got me going. Two thinks I found; 1) When you &amp;ldquo;git&amp;rdquo; floodlight is now builds a directory called floodlight that you have to drop down into to run ant. 2) The current version of floodlight needs 64 bit Java to run. Not sure if you can hack it to run with 32 bit, I just reloaded a 64 bit version.</description>

      <description>A bit of back history: I came from BSD land. I was a FreeBSD user from way back in the 1990s. BSD land is a land of secure boxes and very high uptimes. It&amp;rsquo;s also a land of arguably clunky package support, a lot of compiling by hand and these days, not nearly as encompassing package and network tuning support. I decided to move to Linux&amp;rdquo;) a while ago, reluctantly, and chose Debian as my flavor of choice.</description>

Why use VirtualBox as opposed to KVM? KVM is included with CentOS and fits your quite well into your Windows-less world&amp;hellip; Nick Buraglio - Feb 3, 2013
Just simple experience. I know the vbox CLI pretty well already. Additionally, if I build a VM in VirtualBox on another platform I can easily import and export it. KVM is on my [very] short list to learn, I think it is actually better based on some talkes I&amp;rsquo;ve had, I just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.</description>

      <description>Starting from a base CentOS system with nothing configured, and referencing the CentOS wiki, here is how I like to set up a headless virtualbox environment: Disable selinux. It&amp;rsquo;s overly cumbersome and is enabled by default in CentOS. I like to permanently disable it even though the default is permissive. I ride the edge, I know.``` vi /etc/selinux/config
 and change  SELINUX=enabled
 to  SELINUX=disabled
 Then reboot. Using the methodology I originally found found [here](http://stackoverflow.</description>

      <description>If you are running a network and aren&amp;rsquo;t using RANCID, you should give it a serious look. RANCID is a cross platform configuration management toolkit for backing up router configurations and certain environmental and hardware information into version control. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for as long as I can remember and supports nearly every platform I can think of, including a few modules that I cobbled together myself. There is are a few nice web based front ends for CVS and SVN, I prefer to use ViewVC because I have a lot of experience with it, however, there may be cases where a web server isn&amp;rsquo;t a good option, unavailable or just too much work.</description>

      <description>I have a bunch of Apple wireless gear at my house. It&amp;rsquo;s inexpensive, feature rich and easy to maintain. However, with the update to mountain lion a while ago, the ability to install the older Airport Utility stopped. This is annoying since I have what apple now considers &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; features like IPv6 at my home and essentially all my gear here is a lab (except for the plex server =) I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on cacti lately, and I wanted to test out the syslog plugin&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always annoying to me, being a convert from *BSD to Linux, that tools lke dig and host aren&amp;rsquo;t in the minimal base install. I realise that this makes me somewhat of a hypocrite, as I prefer an additive system rather than a subtractive base OS. Nevertheless, I&amp;rsquo;m continually surprised that &amp;ldquo;host&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t available after installing a minimal CentOS system without adding an additional package. So, since I always forget, here is a quick blog post to remind me and any other converts how to install those tools:``` yum -y install bind-utils</description>

      <description>Securing SSH is a form or art. It&amp;rsquo;s often debated, much like blocking all ICMP packets (which I normally disagree with). If you need good proof, read these posts by Bob Plankers. There is a camp that likes to promote moving to a non-standard port. There is a faction that likes to block it completely except from a handful of hosts. Then there are those that like to leave it open all together.</description>

I do admit tha tI&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by this product. I&amp;rsquo;d seen it work multiple times in demos and it worked so well and looked to easy that we actively tried to throw curve balls at the demo organizer to prove it wasn&amp;rsquo;t canned. It succeeded. The hardware hashing across the VLAGs is very slick. The VMware VSwitch integration worked well and was handy.</description>

      <description>Ryu, an openflow controller, was new to me. After doing 5 minutes of reading I knew I needed to get it up in the lab. The thing that caught my eye was that the project page was boasting support for OpenStack. Now, I don;t really have much experience with openstack, but it has a cult like following and it&amp;rsquo;s on my short list of stuff to get involved with. This seemed like a great excuse.</description>
